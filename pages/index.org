#+TITLE: Welcome to my homepage

* About this site
This website is written using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs][emacs]] [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] with [[https://github.com/SteveLane/org-css][this CSS]] and a small [[https://github.com/darknmt/darknmt.github.io/blob/master/res/theorems.css][modification]] to display LaTeX
structure. The blog is inspired from [[https://ogbe.net/blog/blogging_with_org.html][here]] and [[https://nicolas.petton.fr/blog/blogging-with-org-mode.html][here]].

The reasons that I write this blog instead of using Wordpress are 
1. I am more convenient with editing in emacs using [[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][YASnippet]]. The fact that org-mode is both a MarkDown language
   and a [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html][publishing tool]] is also taken into account.
2. LaTeX (and the writing of mathematics) is not just about mathematical formulae, structures like
   theorem/lemma/definition also play a crucial role.
3. [[https://darknmt.github.io/html/Cheeger-Gromoll-splitting.html][Here]] is a webpage, [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darknmt/darknmt.github.io/master/blog/Cheeger-Gromoll-splitting.org][here]] is what I have to type, and here are the LaTeX exports in [[../res/Cheeger-Gromoll-splitting.tex][TEX]] and [[../res/Cheeger-Gromoll-splitting.pdf][PDF]].
