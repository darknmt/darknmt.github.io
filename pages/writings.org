* Algebraic Geometry - Lecture 3: <2017-10-23 Mon>

Here are some subtle points in the Lecture 3.

** Proof of $\dim = \deg h_K$: Algebraic and Geometric interpretation of intersection

The idea of the proof is to use recurrence on \(\deg h_K\). For the case $\deg h_K = 0$, it
was proposed as an exercise to prove that $X$ is affine. Then $X$ is an finite
dimensional \(k\)-algebra where prime ideals are maximal. The reduction part is base on a
/good intersection/ of the projective scheme $X$ with a hyperplan defined by $f$.

The geometric condition for a /good intersection/ is that the hyperplan does not contain
any top dimensional irreducible component, i.e. 
\[
f\not\in \bigcup_{p \text{ minimal prime }}p
\]
so that the intersection is of dimension decreasing at least 1.

The corresponding algebraic condition is that \( f \) is not a divisor of \( 0 \), so that
one can apply the following result.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Krull principal ideal theorem]
#+ATTR_HTML: :id thm:krull-principal :btit (Krull principal ideal theorem) 
#+BEGIN_theorem
#+LATEX: \label{thm:krull-principal}
Let \( A \) be a noetherian ring, \( f\in A \) and \( p \) is a minimal prime ideal among
those containing \( f \). Then \( ht(p) \leq 1 \), in fact it is \( 0 \) if \( p \)
divises \( 0 \) and \( 1 \) if not.
#+END_theorem

#+BEGIN_remark
One can see that \( \bigcup_{p \text{ minimal prime }}\subset \{ \text{divisors of zero}\}
\) from the more general point of view of /associated prime ideals/. So the algebraic
condition is stricter than the geometric one.

** \( K \)-points of a scheme are closed if \( K/k \) is algebraic
The \( K \)-points of a scheme \( X \) over a field \( k \) are defined as the images of
\( \Spec K \) in \( X \) as \( k \)-scheme. Equivalently, it means that the /residual
field/ \( k(x) = \mathcal{O}_{X,x}/\mathfrak{m}_x \) is a subfield of \( K \).

If \( K/k \) is an algebraic extension then these are closed points. This is equivalent to
the fact that such points are closed in _every_ affine open sets of \( X \).

Let \( U=\Spec A \) be an open set containing a \( k \)-point \( p \), denoted as a prime
ideal of \( A \), then the residual field at \( p \) is \( Frac(A/p) \) the fraction field
of an integral domain \( A/p \) algebraic over \( k \). This also means that \( A/p \) is
actually a field, hence \( p \) is maximal and therefore closed in \( U \).

** Proof of locality of "local noetherian" property

To prove that if a schema \( X \) is a union of noetherian affine scheme then every affine
open set of \( X \) is noetherian, i.e. the property of being local noetherian is a local
property, one reduces the to the following context: \( A \) is a affine scheme cover by
noetherian affine open set \( \Spec B_i \) then \( A \) is noetherian. The idea is to use
quasi-compactness to reduce to the case where \( B_i = A_{f_i} \) and \( i \) belongs to a
finite set.

The subtle point is that if \( \Spec B \subset \Spec A \) than a set \( D(f) \) in \( \Spec
A \) is not neccessarily of form \( D(g) \) in \( \Spec B \). The additional data used
here is that not only \( \Spec B_i \longrightarrow \Spec A \) but this inclusion is also a
morphism between schemes, one therefore can recover the ring morphism \( A \longrightarrow B \).

#+BEGIN_remark
The lesson is that an affine open subset of a scheme \( X \) is not just an open subset
that is affine. It is the image of an affine scheme in \( X \).

* A (decent) map of mathematics <2017-10-17 Tue>

I saw this [[https://www.flickr.com/photos/95869671@N08/32264483720][map of mathematics]] somewhere on YouTube and then again on the door of someone's
office at the I2M. Although this map may help popularise mathematics, it should raise an
eyebrow of a serious math student (or even an attentive highschool student, as for example
1 was listed among prime numbers in an earlier version of this map).

For a decent map of Mathematics, made by a mathematician, see [[http://www.math.unm.edu/~buium/mapp.pdf][this]]. 

* My 2016-2017 internship <2017-07-31 Mon> 

I have just recently finished my Stage3A at [[https://www.i2m.univ-amu.fr/][Institut de Math√©matiques de Marseille]]. It is
also in this period that I start this blog. The memoire can be founded here [[[../res/Stage2017.pdf][PDF]]]
