* A (decent) map of mathematics <2017-10-17 Tue>

I saw this [[https://www.flickr.com/photos/95869671@N08/32264483720][map of mathematics]] somewhere on YouTube and then again on the door of someone's
office at the I2M. Although this map may help popularise mathematics, it should raise an
eyebrow of a serious math student (or even an attentive highschool student, as for example
1 was listed among prime numbers in an earlier version of this map).

For a decent map of Mathematics, made by a mathematician, see [[http://www.math.unm.edu/~buium/mapp.pdf][this]]. 

* My 2016-2017 internship <2017-07-31 Mon> 

I have just recently finished my Stage3A at [[https://www.i2m.univ-amu.fr/][Institut de Math√©matiques de Marseille]]. It is
also in this period that I start this blog. The memoire can be founded here [[[../res/Stage2017.pdf][PDF]]]
