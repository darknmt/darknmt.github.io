* LaTeX indentation in org-mode <2018-02-20 Tue>
  I was told, in accordance with my experience, that we visually process text better if
  each line in a paragraph is approximately below 80 characters. This fact is also
  omnipresent on the internet, standardized tests, books, etc.. being among the
  fundamentals of web design (except wikipedia, that's why I use Wikiwand).

  In Emacs, the key binding ~M-q~ will execute the ~fill-paragraph~ function that
  automatically shrinks text and insert "soft" newlines to shorten line below a certain
  threshold. This function however does not respect the LaTeX structure, e.g. it inserts
  line break inside inline equation and merge display equation.
  format paragraph.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  This is a long long long long long long long long long paragraph with equation \( 1+1 = 
  2+0=3-1=4-2 \) with an equation in display \[ 1+ 1 = 2\].
#+END_SRC

The problem has been noticed around the Internet [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/29122/prevent-fill-paragraph-from-breaking-latex-displayed-equations-in-org-mode][here]] and [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/34938/is-there-a-fill-paragraph-function-which-tries-to-not-break-subordinate-parenthe?rq=1][there]].  

Meanwhile AucTeX does not have this annoying problem. [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/auctex.html#index-LaTeX_002dfill_002dbreak_002dat_002dseparators][It turns out]] that AUCTeX maps the
~M-q~ key to a different function, called ~LaTeX-fill-paragraph~. So the temporary fix is
to load ~latex.el~ in org-mode and maps ~M-q~ to ~LaTeX-fill-paragraph~

#+BEGIN_SRC org
(load "latex.el")
(global-set-key "\M-q" 'LaTeX-fill-paragraph)

* A (decent) map of mathematics <2017-10-17 Tue>

  I saw this [[https://www.flickr.com/photos/95869671@N08/32264483720][map of mathematics]] somewhere on YouTube and then again on the door of
  someone's office at the I2M. Although this map may help popularise mathematics, it
  should raise an eyebrow of a serious math student (or even an attentive highschool
  student, as for example 1 was listed among prime numbers in an earlier version of this
  map).

  For a decent map of Mathematics, made by a mathematician, see [[http://www.math.unm.edu/~buium/mapp.pdf][this]].

* My 2016-2017 internship <2017-07-31 Mon> 

I have just recently finished my Stage3A at [[https://www.i2m.univ-amu.fr/][Institut de Math√©matiques de Marseille]]. It is
also in this period that I start this blog. The memoire can be founded here [[[../res/Stage2017.pdf][PDF]]]
