The decomposition of the simply-connected part corresponds to a decomposition of the tangent bundle into a direct sum whose summands are integrable and stable with respect to any polarisation. Building on recent extension theorems for differential forms on singular spaces, we prove an analogous decomposition theorem for the tangent sheaf of projective varieties with canonical singularities and numerically trivial canonical class. In view of recent progress in minimal model theory, this result can be seen as a first step towards a structure theory of manifolds with Kodaira dimension zero. Based on our main result, we argue that the natural building blocks for any structure theory are two classes of canonical varieties, which generalise the notions of irreducible Calabi-Yau-- and irreducible holomorphic-symplectic manifolds, respectively.},

Up to finite {\textbackslash}'etale cover, it is proved that such manifolds split holomorphically and isometrically as a product of Ricci flat varieties and of rationally connected manifolds. The proof is based on a characterization of rationally connected manifolds through the non existence of certain twisted contravariant tensor products of the tangent bundle, along with a generalized holonomy principle for pseudoeffective line bundles. A crucial ingredient for this is the characterization of uniruledness by the property that the anticanonical bundle is not pseudoeffective.},

	abstract = {This established reference work continues to lead its readers to some of the hottest topics of contemporary mathematical research. The previous edition already introduced and explained the ideas of the parabolic methods that had found a spectacular success in the work of Perelman at the examples of closed geodesics and harmonic forms. It also discussed further examples of geometric variational problems from quantum field theory, another source of profound new ideas and methods in geometry. The 6th edition includes a systematic treatment of eigenvalues of Riemannian manifolds and several other additions. Also, the entire material has been reorganized in order to improve the coherence of the book.From the reviews: "This book provides a very readable introduction to Riemannian geometry and geometric analysis. ... With the vast development of the mathematical subject of geometric analysis, the present textbook is most welcome." Mathematical Reviews"...the material ... is self-contained. Each chapter ends with a set of exercises. Most of the paragraphs have a section ‘Perspectives’, written with the aim to place the material in a broader context and explain further results and directions." Zentralblatt MATH},

Our main results include an explicit formula for the renormalized area of such a minimal surface Y as an integral of local geometric quantities, as well as formulæ for the ﬁrst and second variations of A which are given by integrals of global quantities over the asymptotic boundary loop γ of Y . All of these formulæ are also obtained for a broader class of nonminimal surfaces. The proper setting for the study of this functional (when the ambient space is hyperbolic) requires an understanding of the moduli space of all properly embedded minimal surfaces with smoothly embedded asymptotic boundary. We show that this moduli space is a smooth Banach manifold and develop a Z-valued degree theory for the natural map taking a minimal surface to its boundary curve. We characterize the nondegenerate critical points of A for minimal surfaces in H3, and ﬁnally, discuss the relationship of A to the Willmore functional.},

Here we elaborate on this idea and propose a precise correspondence between conformal field theory observables and those of supergravity: correlation functions in conformal field theory are given by the dependence of the supergravity action on the asymptotic behavior at infinity. In particular, dimensions of operators in conformal field theory are given by masses of particles in supergravity. As quantitative confirmation of this correspondence, we note that the Kaluza-Klein modes of Type IIB supergravity on \$AdS\_5{\textbackslash}times \{{\textbackslash}bf S\}{\textasciicircum}5\$ match with the chiral operators of \${\textbackslash}N=4\$ super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. With some further assumptions, one can deduce a Hamiltonian version of the correspondence and show that the \${\textbackslash}N=4\$ theory has a large \$N\$ phase transition related to the thermodynamics of \$AdS\$ black holes.},

	abstract = {Given an SO(3)-bundle with connection, the associated two-sphere bundle carries a natural closed 2-form. Asking that this be symplectic gives a curvature inequality first considered by Reznikov. We study this inequality in the case when the base has dimension four, with three main aims. Firstly, we use this approach to construct symplectic six-manifolds with c\_1=0 which are never Kahler; e.g., we produce such manifolds with b\_1=0=b\_3 and also with c\_2.omega {\textless}0, answering questions posed by Smith-Thomas-Yau. Examples come from Riemannian geometry, via the Levi-Civita connection on Lambda{\textasciicircum}+. The underlying six-manifold is then the twistor space and often the symplectic structure tames the Eells-Salamon twistor almost complex structure. Our second aim is to exploit this to deduce new results about minimal surfaces: if a certain curvature inequality holds, it follows that the space of minimal surfaces (with fixed topological invariants) is compactifiable; the minimal surfaces must also satisfy an adjunction inequality, unifying and generalising results of Chen--Tian. One metric satisfying the curvature inequality is hyperbolic four-space H{\textasciicircum}4. Our final aim is to show that the corresponding symplectic manifold is symplectomorphic to the small resolution of the conifold xw-yz=0 in C{\textasciicircum}4. We explain how this fits into a hyperbolic description of the conifold transition, with isometries of H{\textasciicircum}4 acting symplectomorphically on the resolution and isometries of H{\textasciicircum}3 acting biholomorphically on the smoothing.},

	title = {A {Survey} of {Minimal} {Surfaces}},
	isbn = {978-0-486-49514-9},
	abstract = {This hardcover edition of A Survey of Minimal Surfaces is divided into twelve sections discussing parametric surfaces, non-parametric surfaces, surfaces that minimize area, isothermal parameters on surfaces, Bernstein\&\#39;s theorem, minimal surfaces with boundary, the Gauss map of parametric surfaces in E3, non-parametric minimal surfaces in E3, application of parametric surfaces to non-parametric problems, and parametric surfaces in En. For this edition, Robert Osserman, Professor of Mathematics at Stanford University, has substantially expanded his original work, including the uses of minimal surfaces to settle important conjectures in relativity and topology. He also discusses new work on Plateau\&\#39;s problem and on isoperimetric inequalities. With a new appendix, supplementary references and expanded index, this Dover edition offers a clear, modern and comprehensive examination of minimal surfaces, providing serious students with fundamental insights into an increasingly active and important area of mathematics.},

Existence and uniqueness of formal expansions defining such metrics are considered. Equivalence with the expansions of associated Poincare metrics is established. Definitions and properties of conformal curvature tensors defined by ambient metrics together with formulation and proof of a jet isomorphism theorem with application to the characterization of scalar conformal invariants are given.},

@article{fefferman_conformal_nodate,
	title = {Conformal invariants},
	abstract = {This paper presents a construction of local invariants of a conformai structure on a Riemannian manifold. The method is to associate to the given conformai manifold M a Ricci flat Riemannian manifold G of two higher dimensions in such a way that invariants of the Riemannian metric on G give rise to conformai invariants on M. The questions of existence and uniqueness of the metric on G reduce to a characteristic initial value problem for Einstein's equations.},
