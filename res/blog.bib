	abstract = {This volume is an English translation of Sakai's textbook on Riemannian Geometry which was originally written in Japanese and published in 1992. The author's intent behind the original book was to provide to advanced undergraduate and graudate students an introduction to modern Riemannian geometry that could also serve as a reference. The book begins with an explanation of the fundamental notion of Riemannian geometry. Special emphasis is placed on understandability and readability, to guide students who are new to this area. The remaining chapters deal with various topics in Riemannian geometry, with the main focus on comparison methods and their applications.},

Then the Calabi conjecture is proved and used to deduce the existence of compact manifolds with holonomy SU(m) (Calabi-Yau manifolds) and Sp(m) (hyperkï¿½hler manifolds). These are constructed and studied using complex algebraic geometry. The second half of the book is devoted to constructions of compact 7- and 8-manifolds with the exceptional holonomy groups 92 and Spin(7). Many new examples are given, and their Betti numbers calculated. The first known examples of these manifolds were discovered by the author in 1993-5. This is the first book to be written about them, and contains much previously unpublished material which significantly improves the original constructions.},

To any Riemannian manifold of dimension n is associated a closed subgroup of SO(n), the holonomy group; this is one of the most basic invariants of the metric. A famous theorem of Berger gives a complete (and rather small) list of the groups which can appear. Surprisingly, the compact manifolds with holonomy smaller than SO(n) are all related in some way to Algebraic Geometry. This leads to the study of special algebraic varieties (Calabi-Yau, complex symplectic or complex contact manifolds) for which Riemannian geometry rises interesting questions.},

The decomposition of the simply-connected part corresponds to a decomposition of the tangent bundle into a direct sum whose summands are integrable and stable with respect to any polarisation. Building on recent extension theorems for differential forms on singular spaces, we prove an analogous decomposition theorem for the tangent sheaf of projective varieties with canonical singularities and numerically trivial canonical class. In view of recent progress in minimal model theory, this result can be seen as a first step towards a structure theory of manifolds with Kodaira dimension zero. Based on our main result, we argue that the natural building blocks for any structure theory are two classes of canonical varieties, which generalise the notions of irreducible Calabi-Yau-- and irreducible holomorphic-symplectic manifolds, respectively.},

Up to finite {\textbackslash}'etale cover, it is proved that such manifolds split holomorphically and isometrically as a product of Ricci flat varieties and of rationally connected manifolds. The proof is based on a characterization of rationally connected manifolds through the non existence of certain twisted contravariant tensor products of the tangent bundle, along with a generalized holonomy principle for pseudoeffective line bundles. A crucial ingredient for this is the characterization of uniruledness by the property that the anticanonical bundle is not pseudoeffective.},
