This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the subject, and shows in detail how such problems can be solved numerically with great efficiency. The book begins with the basic elements of convex sets and functions, and then describes various classes of convex optimization problems. Duality and approximation techniques are then covered, as are statistical estimation techniques. Various geometrical problems are then presented, and there is detailed discussion of unconstrained and constrained minimization problems, and interior-point methods. The focus of the book is on recognizing convex optimization problems and then finding the most appropriate technique for solving them. It contains many worked examples and homework exercises and will appeal to students, researchers and practitioners in fields such as engineering, computer science, mathematics, statistics, finance, and economics.},

The decomposition of the simply-connected part corresponds to a decomposition of the tangent bundle into a direct sum whose summands are integrable and stable with respect to any polarisation. Building on recent extension theorems for differential forms on singular spaces, we prove an analogous decomposition theorem for the tangent sheaf of projective varieties with canonical singularities and numerically trivial canonical class. In view of recent progress in minimal model theory, this result can be seen as a first step towards a structure theory of manifolds with Kodaira dimension zero. Based on our main result, we argue that the natural building blocks for any structure theory are two classes of canonical varieties, which generalise the notions of irreducible Calabi-Yau-- and irreducible holomorphic-symplectic manifolds, respectively.},

Up to finite {\textbackslash}'etale cover, it is proved that such manifolds split holomorphically and isometrically as a product of Ricci flat varieties and of rationally connected manifolds. The proof is based on a characterization of rationally connected manifolds through the non existence of certain twisted contravariant tensor products of the tangent bundle, along with a generalized holonomy principle for pseudoeffective line bundles. A crucial ingredient for this is the characterization of uniruledness by the property that the anticanonical bundle is not pseudoeffective.},

To any Riemannian manifold of dimension n is associated a closed subgroup of SO(n), the holonomy group; this is one of the most basic invariants of the metric.

Surprisingly, the compact manifolds with holonomy smaller than SO(n) are all related in some way to Algebraic Geometry. This leads to the study of special algebraic varieties (Calabi-Yau, complex symplectic or complex contact manifolds) for which Riemannian geometry rises interesting questions.},

	abstract = {Based on a highly regarded lecture course at Moscow State University, this is a clear and systematic introduction to gauge field theory. It is unique in providing the means to master gauge field theory prior to the advanced study of quantum mechanics. Though gauge field theory is typically included in courses on quantum field theory, many of its ideas and results can be understood at the classical or semi-classical level. Accordingly, this book is organized so that its early chapters require no special knowledge of quantum mechanics. Aspects of gauge field theory relying on quantum mechanics are introduced only later and in a graduated fashion--making the text ideal for students studying gauge field theory and quantum mechanics simultaneously. The book begins with the basic concepts on which gauge field theory is built. It introduces gauge-invariant Lagrangians and describes the spectra of linear perturbations, including perturbations above nontrivial ground states. The second part focuses on the construction and interpretation of classical solutions that exist entirely due to the nonlinearity of field equations: solitons, bounces, instantons, and sphalerons. The third section considers some of the interesting effects that appear due to interactions of fermions with topological scalar and gauge fields. Mathematical digressions and numerous problems are included throughout. An appendix sketches the role of instantons as saddle points of Euclidean functional integral and related topics. Perfectly suited as an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate text, this book is an excellent starting point for anyone seeking to understand gauge fields.},

	abstract = {We analyse the following (solitaire) game: each node of a graph contains a pile of chips, and a move consists of selecting a node with at least as many chips on it as its degree, and letting it send one chip to each of its neighbors. The game terminates if there is no such node. We show that the finiteness of the game and the terminating configuration are independent of the moves made. If the number of chips is less than the number of edges, the game is always finite. If the number of chips is at least the number of edges, the game can be infinite for an appropriately chosen initial configuration. If the number of chips is more than twice the number of edges minus the number of nodes, then the game is always infinite.

The independence of the finiteness and the terminating position follows from simple but powerful ‘exchange properties’ of the sequences of legal moves, and from some general results on ‘antimatroids with repetition’, i.e. languages having these exchange properties. We relate the number of steps in a finite game to the least positive eigenvalue of the Laplace operator of the graph.},

The rank of a divisor on a metric graph is a concept appearing in the Riemann–Roch theorem for metric graphs (or tropical curves) due to Gathmann and Kerber, and Mikhalkin and Zharkov. We define a rank-determining set of a metric graph Γ to be a subset A of Γ such that the rank of a divisor D on Γ is always equal to the rank of D restricted on A. We show constructively in this paper that there exist finite rank-determining sets. In addition, we investigate the properties of rank-determining sets in general and formulate a criterion for rank-determining sets.

Each problem is explained with the present status of its solution and the most recent methods of approaching the proofs. The main aim is to explain some methods and new techniques, and to apply them to problems coming from geometry or from physics. It deals with such important subjects as variational methods, the continuity method, parabolic equations on fiber bundles, ideas concerning points of concentration, blowing-up technique, topological methods. ..........},

This enables the reader to obtain a sweeping panoramic view of almost the entirety of the field. However, since a Riemannian manifold is, even initially, a subtle object, appealing to highly non-natural concepts, the first three chapters devote themselves to introducing the various concepts and tools of Riemannian geometry in the most natural and motivating way, following in particular Gauss and Riemann.},

Our main results include an explicit formula for the renormalized area of such a minimal surface Y as an integral of local geometric quantities, as well as formulæ for the ﬁrst and second variations of A which are given by integrals of global quantities over the asymptotic boundary loop γ of Y . All of these formulæ are also obtained for a broader class of nonminimal surfaces. The proper setting for the study of this functional (when the ambient space is hyperbolic) requires an understanding of the moduli space of all properly embedded minimal surfaces with smoothly embedded asymptotic boundary. We show that this moduli space is a smooth Banach manifold and develop a Z-valued degree theory for the natural map taking a minimal surface to its boundary curve. We characterize the nondegenerate critical points of A for minimal surfaces in H3, and ﬁnally, discuss the relationship of A to the Willmore functional.},

That first paper treated basic mapping theory, focusing on semi-Fredholm properties on weighted Sobolev and H{\textbackslash}"older spaces and regularity in the form of asymptotic expansions of solutions. The present paper builds on this through the formulation of boundary conditions and the construction of parametrices for the associated boundary problems. As before, the emphasis is on the geometric microlocal structure of the Schwartz kernels of parametrices and generalized inverses.},

When \$k=1\$ this is equivalent to the familiar Yamabe problem, and the corresponding metrics are complete with constant negative scalar curvature. We show for every \$k\$ that the deformation theory for this problem is unobstructed, so in particular the set of conformal classes containing a solution of any one of these equations is open in the space of all conformal classes. We then observe that the common intersection of these solution spaces coincides with the space of conformally compact Einstein metrics, and hence this space is a finite intersection of closed analytic submanifolds.},

Here we elaborate on this idea and propose a precise correspondence between conformal field theory observables and those of supergravity: correlation functions in conformal field theory are given by the dependence of the supergravity action on the asymptotic behavior at infinity. In particular, dimensions of operators in conformal field theory are given by masses of particles in supergravity. As quantitative confirmation of this correspondence, we note that the Kaluza-Klein modes of Type IIB supergravity on \$AdS\_5{\textbackslash}times \{{\textbackslash}bf S\}{\textasciicircum}5\$ match with the chiral operators of \${\textbackslash}N=4\$ super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. With some further assumptions, one can deduce a Hamiltonian version of the correspondence and show that the \${\textbackslash}N=4\$ theory has a large \$N\$ phase transition related to the thermodynamics of \$AdS\$ black holes.},

The second volume describes the topological and algebro-geometrical aspects of the theory: monodromy, intersection forms, oscillatory integrals, asymptotics, and mixed Hodge structures of singularities. The first volume has been adapted for the needs of non-mathematicians, presupposing a limited mathematical background and beginning at an elementary level. With this foundation, the book's sophisticated development permits readers to explore more applications than previous books on singularities.},

	abstract = {Given an SO(3)-bundle with connection, the associated two-sphere bundle carries a natural closed 2-form. Asking that this be symplectic gives a curvature inequality first considered by Reznikov. We study this inequality in the case when the base has dimension four, with three main aims. Firstly, we use this approach to construct symplectic six-manifolds with c\_1=0 which are never Kahler; e.g., we produce such manifolds with b\_1=0=b\_3 and also with c\_2.omega {\textless}0, answering questions posed by Smith-Thomas-Yau. Examples come from Riemannian geometry, via the Levi-Civita connection on Lambda{\textasciicircum}+. The underlying six-manifold is then the twistor space and often the symplectic structure tames the Eells-Salamon twistor almost complex structure. Our second aim is to exploit this to deduce new results about minimal surfaces: if a certain curvature inequality holds, it follows that the space of minimal surfaces (with fixed topological invariants) is compactifiable; the minimal surfaces must also satisfy an adjunction inequality, unifying and generalising results of Chen--Tian. One metric satisfying the curvature inequality is hyperbolic four-space H{\textasciicircum}4. Our final aim is to show that the corresponding symplectic manifold is symplectomorphic to the small resolution of the conifold xw-yz=0 in C{\textasciicircum}4. We explain how this fits into a hyperbolic description of the conifold transition, with isometries of H{\textasciicircum}4 acting symplectomorphically on the resolution and isometries of H{\textasciicircum}3 acting biholomorphically on the smoothing.},
