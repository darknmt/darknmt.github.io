The decomposition of the simply-connected part corresponds to a decomposition of the tangent bundle into a direct sum whose summands are integrable and stable with respect to any polarisation. Building on recent extension theorems for differential forms on singular spaces, we prove an analogous decomposition theorem for the tangent sheaf of projective varieties with canonical singularities and numerically trivial canonical class. In view of recent progress in minimal model theory, this result can be seen as a first step towards a structure theory of manifolds with Kodaira dimension zero. Based on our main result, we argue that the natural building blocks for any structure theory are two classes of canonical varieties, which generalise the notions of irreducible Calabi-Yau-- and irreducible holomorphic-symplectic manifolds, respectively.},

The proof is based on a characterization of rationally connected manifolds through the non existence of certain twisted contravariant tensor products of the tangent bundle, along with a generalized holonomy principle for pseudoeffective line bundles. A crucial ingredient for this is the characterization of uniruledness by the property that the anticanonical bundle is not pseudoeffective.},

Surprisingly, the compact manifolds with holonomy smaller than SO(n) are all related in some way to Algebraic Geometry. This leads to the study of special algebraic varieties (Calabi-Yau, complex symplectic or complex contact manifolds) for which Riemannian geometry rises interesting questions.},

All of these formulæ are also obtained for a broader class of nonminimal surfaces. The proper setting for the study of this functional (when the ambient space is hyperbolic) requires an understanding of the moduli space of all properly embedded minimal surfaces with smoothly embedded asymptotic boundary. We show that this moduli space is a smooth Banach manifold and develop a Z-valued degree theory for the natural map taking a minimal surface to its boundary curve.

When \$k=1\$ this is equivalent to the familiar Yamabe problem, and the corresponding metrics are complete with constant negative scalar curvature. We show for every \$k\$ that the deformation theory for this problem is unobstructed, so in particular the set of conformal classes containing a solution of any one of these equations is open in the space of all conformal classes. We then observe that the common intersection of these solution spaces coincides with the space of conformally compact Einstein metrics, and hence this space is a finite intersection of closed analytic submanifolds.},

Here we elaborate on this idea and propose a precise correspondence between conformal field theory observables and those of supergravity: correlation functions in conformal field theory are given by the dependence of the supergravity action on the asymptotic behavior at infinity. In particular, dimensions of operators in conformal field theory are given by masses of particles in supergravity. As quantitative confirmation of this correspondence, we note that the Kaluza-Klein modes of Type IIB supergravity on \$AdS\_5{\textbackslash}times \{{\textbackslash}bf S\}{\textasciicircum}5\$ match with the chiral operators of \${\textbackslash}N=4\$ super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. With some further assumptions, one can deduce a Hamiltonian version of the correspondence and show that the \${\textbackslash}N=4\$ theory has a large \$N\$ phase transition related to the thermodynamics of \$AdS\$ black holes.},

The second volume describes the topological and algebro-geometrical aspects of the theory: monodromy, intersection forms, oscillatory integrals, asymptotics, and mixed Hodge structures of singularities. The first volume has been adapted for the needs of non-mathematicians, presupposing a limited mathematical background and beginning at an elementary level.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.3648},
	abstract = {Given an SO(3)-bundle with connection, the associated two-sphere bundle carries a natural closed 2-form. Asking that this be symplectic gives a curvature inequality first considered by Reznikov. We study this inequality in the case when the base has dimension four, with three main aims. Firstly, we use this approach to construct symplectic six-manifolds with c\_1=0 which are never Kahler; e.g., we produce such manifolds with b\_1=0=b\_3 and also with c\_2.omega {\textless}0, answering questions posed by Smith-Thomas-Yau. Examples come from Riemannian geometry, via the Levi-Civita connection on Lambda{\textasciicircum}+. The underlying six-manifold is then the twistor space and often the symplectic structure tames the Eells-Salamon twistor almost complex structure. Our second aim is to exploit this to deduce new results about minimal surfaces: if a certain curvature inequality holds, it follows that the space of minimal surfaces (with fixed topological invariants) is compactifiable; the minimal surfaces must also satisfy an adjunction inequality, unifying and generalising results of Chen--Tian. One metric satisfying the curvature inequality is hyperbolic four-space H{\textasciicircum}4. Our final aim is to show that the corresponding symplectic manifold is symplectomorphic to the small resolution of the conifold xw-yz=0 in C{\textasciicircum}4. We explain how this fits into a hyperbolic description of the conifold transition, with isometries of H{\textasciicircum}4 acting symplectomorphically on the resolution and isometries of H{\textasciicircum}3 acting biholomorphically on the smoothing.},

	abstract = {We study the evolution of the renormalized volume functional for asymptotically Poincare-Einstein metrics (M,g) which are evolving by normalized Ricci flow. In particular, we prove that the time derivative of the renormalized volume along the flow is the negative integral of scal(g(t)) + n(n-1) over the manifold. This implies that if scal(g(0))+n(n-1) is non-negative at t=0, then the renormalized volume decreases monotonically. We also discuss how, when n=4, our results describe the Hawking-Page phase transition. Differences in renormalized volumes give rigorous meaning to the Hawking-Page difference of actions and describe the free energy liberated in the transition.},

	abstract = {Numerous elliptic and parabolic variational problems arising in physics and geometry (Ginzburg-Landau equations, harmonic maps, Yang-Mills fields, Omega-instantons, Yamabe equations, geometric flows in general...) possess a critical dimension in which an invariance group (similitudes, conformal groups) acts. This common feature generates, in all these different situations, the same non-linear effect. One observes a strict splitting in space between an almost linear regime and a dominantly non-linear regime which has two major characteristics : it requires a quantized amount of energy and arises along rectifiable objects of special geometric interest (geodesics, minimal surfaces, J-holomorphic curves, special Lagrangian manifolds, mean-curvature flows...).},

The aim of this article is to place this diﬀerential equation in a new framework, in which it is both elliptic and a stationary point of a parabolic ﬂow. To do this, we exploit a link with deﬁnite connections (introduced in [12]) to draw an analogy with instantons and the Yang–Mills ﬂow. This picture leads to a natural conjecture, analogous to one made by Donaldson concerning hyperk¨ahler 4-manifolds [9]. It also provides a moment-map description of the anti-self-dual Einstein equations with non-zero scalar curvature.},

	abstract = {General Relativity in 4 dimensions can be equivalently described as a dynamical theory of SO(3) ∼ SU(2)-connections rather than metrics. We introduce the notion of asymptotically hyperbolic connections, and work out an analog of the Feﬀerman–Graham expansion in the language of connections. As in the metric setup, one can solve the arising “evolution” equations order by order in the expansion in powers of the radial coordinate. The solution in the connection setting is arguably simpler, and very straightforward algebraic manipulations allow one to see how the obstruction appears at third order in the expansion. Another interesting feature of the connection formulation is that the “counter terms” required in the computation of the renormalised volume all combine into the Chern–Simons functional of the restriction of the connection to the boundary. As the Chern-Simons invariant is only deﬁned modulo large gauge transformations, the requirement that the path integral over asymptotically hyperbolic connections is well-deﬁned requires the cosmological constant to be quantised. Finally, in the connection setting one can deform the 4D Einstein condition in an interesting way, and we show that asymptotically hyperbolic connection expansion is universal and valid for any of the deformed theories.},

In particular, it is shown that the well-known conjugation between the belicoid and the catenoid in euclidean three-space extends naturally to hyperbolic three-space H3; in the latter case, catenoids are of three different types and the explicit correspondence is given.

	abstract = {The recent introduction of the Seiberg-Witten invariants of smooth four-manifolds has revolutionized the study of those manifolds. The invariants are gauge-theoretic in nature and are close cousins of the much-studied SU(2)-invariants defined over fifteen years ago by Donaldson. On a practical level, the new invariants have proved to be more powerful and have led to a vast generalization of earlier results. This book is an introduction to the Seiberg-Witten invariants.  The work begins with a review of the classical material on Spin \textit{c} structures and their associated Dirac operators. Next comes a discussion of the Seiberg-Witten equations, which is set in the context of nonlinear elliptic operators on an appropriate infinite dimensional space of configurations. It is demonstrated that the space of solutions to these equations, called the Seiberg-Witten moduli space, is finite dimensional, and its dimension is then computed. In contrast to the SU(2)-case, the Seiberg-Witten moduli spaces are shown to be compact. The Seiberg-Witten invariant is then essentially the homology class in the space of configurations represented by the Seiberg-Witten moduli space. The last chapter gives a flavor for the applications of these new invariants by computing the invariants for most Kahler surfaces and then deriving some basic toological consequences for these surfaces.},

If the metric is generic, then the zero set of this form is a disjoint union of circles. On the complement of this zero set, the symplectic form and the metric deﬁne an almost complex structure; and the latter can be used to deﬁne pseudo-holomorphic submanifolds and subvarieties. The main theorem in this paper asserts that if the 4–manifold has a non zero Seiberg–Witten invariant, then the zero set of any given self-dual harmonic 2–form is the boundary of a pseudo-holomorphic subvariety in its complement.},

Naturally, it also plays an important role in geometry: theory of Riemannian surfaces, Weyl tensors, \$Q\$-curvature, Yang-Mills fields, etc... We shall be concerned with the study of conformal invariance in analysis. More precisely, we will focus on the study of nonlinear PDEs arising from conformally invariant two dimensional variational problems (e.g. harmonic maps, prescribed mean curvature surfaces, Willmore and Constrained conformal surfaces, isothermic surfaces). The present manuscript are lecture notes of courses given by the author at several places including UBC Vancouver, SNS Pisa, IHP Paris, ICTP Trieste.},

This divergence free quantities generalize to target manifolds without symmetries the well known conservation laws for harmonic maps into homogeneous spaces. From this form we can recover, without the use of moving frame, all the classical regularity results known for 2-dimensional conformally invariant non-linear elliptic PDE . It enable us also to establish new results. In particular we solve a conjecture by E.Heinz asserting that the solutions to the precribed bounded mean curvature equation in arbitrary manifolds are continuous.},

We describe several examples which show that there are either many more Calabi-Yau manifolds (e.g. rigid ones) than previously thought or there exist ``symplectic Calabi-Yaus'' -- non-Kaehler symplectic 6-folds with c\_1=0. The analogous surgery in four dimensions, with a generalisation to ADE-trees of Lagrangians, implies that the canonical class of a minimal complex surface contains symplectic forms if and only if it has positive square.},

We study this holographic geometrical method of calculating the entanglement entropy in the vacuum case of a CFT which is holographically dual to empty anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. Namely, we investigate the minimal surfaces spanned on boundaries of spherical domains at inﬁnity of hyperbolic space, which represents a timeslice of AdS spacetime. We consider a generic position of two spherical domains: two disjoint domains, overlapping domains, and touching domains. All these cases are treated in a uniﬁed way. We ﬁnd exact expressions in a closed form for the minimal surfaces and the renormalized expression for the area. We study also the embedding of the minimal surfaces into full AdS spacetime and we ﬁnd that for a proper choice of the static Killing vector we can model a dynamical situation of “tearing” of the minimal surface when the domains on which it is spanned are moved away from each other.},

Readers are advised to begin with this paper. We survey the major results of the previous four papers, giving brief explanations of the proofs. We apply the results to describe the boundary of a moduli space of compact, nonsingular SL m-folds N in M. We prove the existence of special Lagrangian connected sums N\_1 \# ... \# N\_k of SL m-folds N\_1,...,N\_k in M. We also study SL 3-folds with T{\textasciicircum}2-cone singularities, proving results related to ideas of the author on invariants of Calabi-Yau 3-folds and the SYZ Conjecture. Let X be a compact SL m-fold with isolated conical singularities x\_i and cones C\_i for i=1,...,n. The first paper math.DG/0211294 studied the regularity of X near its singular points, and the the second paper math.DG/0211295 the moduli space of deformations of X. The third and fourth papers math.DG/0302355, math.DG/0302356 construct desingularizations of X, realizing X as a limit of a family of compact, nonsingular SL m-folds N{\textasciicircum}t in M for small t{\textgreater}0. Let L\_i be an Asymptotically Conical SL m-fold in C{\textasciicircum}m asymptotic to C\_i at infinity. We make N{\textasciicircum}t by gluing tL\_i into X at x\_i for i=1,...n.},

As such, it is a fundamental and an essential tool in the study of differentiable manifolds.   In this volume, the authors provide a thorough introduction to characteristic classes, with detailed studies of Stiefel-Whitney classes, Chern classes, Pontrjagin classes, and the Euler class. Three appendices cover the basics of cohomology theory and the differential forms approach to characteristic classes, and provide an account of Bernoulli numbers.   Based on lecture notes of John Milnor, which first appeared at Princeton University in 1957 and have been widely studied by graduate students of topology ever since, this published version has been completely revised and corrected.},

	abstract = {"This book gives a clear introductory account of equivariant cohomology, a central topic in algebraic topology. Equivariant cohomology is concerned with the algebraic topology of spaces with a group action, or in other words, with symmetries of spaces. First defined in the 1950s, it has been introduced into K-theory and algebraic geometry, but it is in algebraic topology that the concepts are the most transparent and the proofs are the simplest. One of the most useful applications of equivariant cohomology is the equivariant localization theorem of Atiyah-Bott and Berline-Vergne, which converts the integral of an equivariant differential form into a finite sum over the fixed point set of the group action, providing a powerful tool for computing integrals over a manifold. Because integrals and symmetries are ubiquitous, equivariant cohomology has found applications in diverse areas of mathematics and physics. Assuming readers have taken one semester of manifold theory and a year of algebraic topology, Loring Tu begins with the topological construction of equivariant cohomology, then develops the theory for smooth manifolds with the aid of differential forms. To keep the exposition simple, the equivariant localization theorem is proven only for a circle action. An appendix gives a proof of the equivariant de Rham theorem, demonstrating that equivariant cohomology can be computed using equivariant differential forms. Examples and calculations illustrate new concepts. Exercises include hints or solutions, making this book suitable for self-study"--},

The boundary conditions are defined by a "Nahm pole" away from the knot with a further singularity along the knot. In a previous paper, we gave a precise formulation of the Nahm pole boundary condition in the absence of knots, in the present paper, we do this in the more general case with knots included. We show that the KW equations with generalized Nahm pole boundary conditions are elliptic, and that the solutions are polyhomogeneous near the boundary and near the knot, with exponents determined by solutions of appropriate indicial equations. This involves the analysis of a "depth two incomplete iterated edge operator." As in our previous paper, a key ingredient in the analysis is a convenient new Weitzenb{\textbackslash}"ock formula that is well-adapted to the specific problem.\vphantom{\{}\}},

	abstract = {We give new examples of compact, negatively curved Einstein manifolds of dimension 4. These are seemingly the ﬁrst such examples which are not locally homogeneous. Our metrics are carried by a sequence of 4-manifolds (Xk) previously considered by Gromov and Thurston [21]. The construction begins with a certain sequence (Mk) of hyperbolic 4-manifolds, each containing a totally geodesic surface Σk which is nullhomologous and whose normal injectivity radius tends to inﬁnity with k. For a ﬁxed choice of natural number l, we consider the l-fold cover Xk → Mk branched along Σk. We prove that for any choice of l and all large enough k (depending on l), Xk carries an Einstein metric of negative sectional curvature. The ﬁrst step in the proof is to ﬁnd an approximate Einstein metric on Xk, which is done by interpolating between a model Einstein metric near the branch locus and the pull-back of the hyperbolic metric from Mk. The second step in the proof is to perturb this to a genuine solution to Einstein’s equations, by a parameter dependent version of the inverse function theorem. The analysis relies on a delicate bootstrap procedure based on L2 coercivity estimates.},

Let Z be the set of points at which the areas of the Mi blow up. We prove that Z behaves in some ways like a minimal variety without boundary. In particular, it satisﬁes the same maximum and barrier principles that a smooth minimal submanifold satisﬁes. For suitable open subsets W of N , this allows one to show that if the areas of the Mi are uniformly bounded on compact subsets of W , then the areas are in fact uniformly bounded on all compact subsets of N . Similar results are proved for varieties with bounded mean curvature. The results about area blow-up sets are used to show that the Allard Regularity Theorems can be applied in some situations where key hypotheses appear to be missing. In particular, we prove a version of the Allard Boundary Regularity Theorem that does not require any area bounds. For example, we prove that if a sequence of smooth minimal submanifolds converge as sets to a subset of a smooth, connected, properly embedded manifold with nonempty boundary, and if the convergence of the boundaries is smooth, then the convergence is smooth everywhere.},

Fix a finite presentation of Γ and let P be the 2-dimensional cell complex whose 1-cells correspond in the usual way to the generators and the 2-cells to the relations in Γ, such that π1(P) = Γ.

Our main result is a solution to the codimension 4 conjecture, namely that X is smooth away from a closed subset of codimen sion 4. We combine this result with the ideas of quantitative stratification to prove a priori Lq estimates on the full curvature {\textbar}Rm{\textbar} for all q {\textless} 2. In the case of Einstein manifolds, we improve this to estimates on the reg ularity scale. We apply this to prove a conjecture of Anderson that the collection of 4-manifolds (M4,g) with {\textbar}RicM4{\textbar} {\textless} 3, Vol(M) {\textgreater} v {\textgreater} 0, and diam(M) {\textless} D contains at most a finite number of diffeomorphism classes. A local version is used to show that noncollapsed 4-manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature have a priori L2 Riemannian curvature estimates.},

	abstract = {[The helicity of a localized solenoidal vector field (i.e. the integrated scalar product of the field and its vector potential) is known to be a conserved quantity under `frozen field' distortion of the ambient medium. In this paper we present a number of results concerning the helicity of linked and knotted flux tubes, particularly as regards the topological interpretation of helicity in terms of the Gauss linking number and its limiting form (the Calugareanu invariant). The helicity of a single knotted flux tube is shown to be intimately related to the Calugareanu invariant and a new and direct derivation of this topological invariant from the invariance of helicity is given. Helicity is decomposed into writhe and twist contributions, the writhe contribution involving the Gauss integral (for definition, see equation (4.8)), which admits interpretation in terms of the sum of signed crossings of the knot, averaged over all projections. Part of the twist contribution is shown to be associated with the torsion of the knot and part with what may be described as `intrinsic twist' of the field lines in the flux tube around the knot (see equations (5.13) and (5.15)). The generic behaviour associated with the deformation of the knot through a configuration with points of inflexion (points at which the curvature vanishes) is analysed and the role of the twist parameter is discussed. The derivation of the Calugareanu invariant from first principles of fluid mechanics provides a good demonstration of the relevance of fluid dynamical techniques to topological problems.]},
