#+TITLE: Writing of Mathematics in LaTeX
#+SETUPFILE: ../res/mathsetup.org

* First para
It is difficult to write reusable notes in mathematics. Many (including anh Tu) use writing as a way
to reformulate ideas/knownledge and do not read their own notes again. But memory is obviously not
my advantage and I will have to consult my writings later for sure.

* Second para
My mathematical writings in this moment is not a blog, that is I have no public audience hence no
obligation to keep things formal. The disadvantage of this hermit life is that I usually find myself
unable to understand my own notes.


# <<thm:1>>
#+BEGIN_theorem
This is a theorem
\[
a^2 +a^2 = 2a^2 +\int_0^1 0dx
\]
#+END_theorem

# <<thm:2>>
#+BEGIN_theorem
#+latex: \label{thm:2}%
Here is another $a+b=c$.
#+END_theorem

a 
** Much more complecated
   # <<lem:1>>
   #+BEGIN_lemma
   #+LATEX: \label{lem:1}%
If $1+1=2$ then $2+2=4$, therefore
\[
e=mc^2
\]
   #+END_lemma

Is it working?
