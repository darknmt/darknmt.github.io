* Harmonic maps
** Variational approach: energy integral and tension field
**** Notation.
Let \( M, M', M''\) be Riemannian manifolds of dimension \( n, n' \) and \( n', n''\)
respectively. We will use \( i,j,k,\dots, \alpha,\beta,\gamma,\dots, a,b,c \) for local
coordinates of \( M, M', M'' \).
Let \( f: M \longrightarrow M', f': M' \longrightarrow M''\) be a smooth maps, one denotes
\[
f^\alpha_i = \frac{\partial f^\alpha}{\partial x^i},\quad f^\alpha_{ij} =
\frac{\partial^2 f^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j} - \Gamma_{ij}^k f^{\alpha}_k \]
so that \( \nabla g = g_i dx^i \) and \( \nabla (\nabla g) = g_{ij}dx^i\otimes dx^j \)

#+BEGIN_definition
The *energy desity* of \( f \) at \( p\in m \) is defined by
\[
e(f)(p) = \frac{1}{2}\langle g(p), f^g(p) \rangle_p = \frac{1}{2}g^{ij}f^\alpha_i
f^\beta_j g'_{\alpha\beta}
\]
and the *energy functional* of \( f \) is
\[
E(f) = \int_M e(f) dV = \frac{1}{2}\int_M g^{ij}f^\alpha_i
f^\beta_j g'_{\alpha\beta} |\det (g_{ij})|^\frac{1}{2} dx^1\wedge \dots\wedge dx^n
\]
#+END_definition

We recall that the inner product is between 2 tensors of type \( (p,q) \) \( S =
S^{i_1\dots i_p}_{j_1\dots j_q}, T = T^{k_1\dots k_p}_{l_1\dots l_q} \) is \( \prod_{m,n}
g_{i_m k_m} g^{j_n l_m}S^{i_1\dots i_p}_{j_1\dots j_q} T^{k_1\dots k_p}_{l_1\dots l_q}  \)

#+BEGIN_remark
Under any orthonormal basis of \( T_P M \) and \( T_{f(P)}N \), one can see that the
energy density is non-negative at every point. Hence \( E(f) = 0 \) if and only if \(
e(f)=0 \) at all points if and only if \( f \) is constant.
#+END_remark

#+BEGIN_definition
Let \( \sigma \) be a symmetric function of \( n \) variables and \( \alpha \) be a
symmetric (0,2) tensor field, one can define the *\(
\sigma- \)energy desity* of \( \alpha \) at \( P\in M \) to be \( \sigma
(\beta_1,\dots,\beta_n)(P) \) where \( \beta_i \) are eigenvalues of the linear operator
\( (g^{ik}\alpha_{ij})_{k,j} \). The *\( \sigma \)-energy* of \( \alpha \) is \( I_\sigma(\alpha)
:= \int_M  \sigma(\alpha) dV\)

Take \( \alpha = f^*g' \), one calls \( \sigma(\alpha) \) the /\( \sigma \)-energy density
of \( f \) and \( I_\sigma(\alpha) \) the \( \sigma \)-energy of \( f \).
#+END_definition

#+BEGIN_exampl
For example, the energy functional \( E(f) \) is \( I_\frac{\sigma_1}{2}(f) \). \(
V(f):=I_{\sigma^{1/2}_n}(f) \) is called the *volume* of \( f \).

Let \( f_t: M \longrightarrow M' \) be a smooth family of smooth maps between Riemannian
manifolds for \( t\in (t_0,t_1) \). Then
\[
\frac{d}{dt}E(f_t) = -\int_M \left(\Delta f_t^\gamma +g^{ij}\Gamma'^{\gamma}_{\alpha\beta}
f^{\alpha}_{t,i}f^{\beta}_{t,j}\right) g'_{\gamma\nu} \frac{\partial f_t^\nu}{\partial
t}dV,\qquad \forall t\in (t_0,t_1)
\]

#+BEGIN_definition
1. A *vector field along \( f: M \longrightarrow M' \)* is a smooth application \(v: M\longrightarrow TM'\) such that \( \pi\circ v = f \) where \( \pi: TM' \longrightarrow M'\) is the canonical projection. In other words, it is the association of each point \(P\in M \) a tangent vector at \( f(P) \)
2. The *tension field* of \( f \) is the following vector field along \( f \) defined by
   \[
   \tau(f)^\gamma:= \Delta f^\gamma +g^{ij}\Gamma'^{\gamma}_{\alpha\beta} f^{\alpha}_{i}f^{\beta}_{j}
   \]
   By the Lemma ref:lem:var-energy, \( \tau(f) \) is the unique vector field along \( f \)
   such that \( \frac{d }{dt}E(f_t) = -\int_M \langle \tau(f), \frac{df_t}{dt}\rangle \). In
   particular, if \( f_t \) is the variation of \( f \) along a vector field \( v \) along
   \( f \), i.e. \(f_t(P) = \exp_{f(P)}(tv(P))\) then \(\nabla_v E(f) = - \langle \tau(f), v
   \rangle\) along \( f \).
3. \( f: M \longrightarrow M' \) is called *harmonic* if \( \tau(f)=0 \), or equivalently
   \( f \) is a critical point of \( E \).
#+END_definition

In normal coordinates of \( M \) at \( P \) and \( M' \) at \( f(P) \), the tension field
of \( f \) is given by
\[
\tau^\gamma(f)(P) = \sum_i \frac{\partial^2 f^\gamma}{\partial (x^i)^2}(P)
\]

#+BEGIN_remark
1. If \( M' \) is flat, i.e. \( R'_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta} = 0 \) then \( \tau(f)^\gamma
   = \Delta f^\gamma\) is linear in \( f \).
2. Since \( \tau(f) \) depends locally on \( f \), isometries and covering maps are
   harmonic.

#+BEGIN_proposition
#+LATEX: \label{prop:holo-harmonic}
Holomorphic maps between Kahler manifolds are harmonic.
#+END_proposition
#+BEGIN_proof
We recall that exponential functions \( \exp_P: T_PM \longrightarrow M' \) on a Kahler
manifold \( M \) are holomorphic for any \( P\in M \). In fact, let \( v\in T_PM \) and \( \delta
v \in T_v(T_P M) \) be a tangent vector  at \( v \) and denote abusively by \( J \) the complex
structure of the complex vector space \( T_P M \) and that of \( M \), one needs to see that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tangent-exp}
D\exp_P(v).J\delta v = J(\exp_P(v)) D \exp_P(v).\delta v
\end{equation}

In fact, let \( Y_1, Y_2 \) be Jacobi fields along \( U(t) =  \exp_P(tv) \) the
geodesics of \( M \) starting at \( P \) in direction \( v \) with \( Y_1(0)=Y_2(0) = 0,
\dot Y_1(0) = \delta v, \dot Y_2(0) = J\delta v \) then
the LHS of eqref:eq:tangent-exp is \( Y_2(1) \), and the RHS is \( J(U(1)) Y_1(1) \). Then one can see
that \( Y_2(t) - J(U(t)) Y_1(t) = 0\) for every \( t\in [0,1] \) since it is true at \( t=0
\) and the derivative with respect to \( t \) vanishes as \( \nabla_{\dot U}J = 0 \).  

Therefore, at a point \( P \) of a Kahler manifold \( M \), there exist holomorphic coordinates \( z^j = x^j + i y^j \) of \( M \) in a
neighborhood of \( P \) such that \( \{ x_j,y_j: j=\overline{1,n/2} \} \) are normal
coordinates centered in \( P \). Using such coordinates for \( P\in M \) and \( f(P)\in M'
\), one has \( f^\gamma=0 \) since \( f^\gamma \) is holomorphic and \(
\Gamma'^\gamma_{\alpha\beta}(P)=0 \) by normality, it follows that \( \tau(f)=0 \) at
every point \( P\in M \).
#+END_proof


** Formulation using connection on vector bundle
**** Setup and notation.
Let \( E \) be a metric vector bundle over a Riemannian manifold \( M \), i.e. each fiber
of \( E \) is equiped with an inner product that we denote by \( (g'_{\alpha\beta}) \). The
metric of \( M \) is denoted by \( (g_{ij}) \). Let \( n \) and \( m \) be the dimension
of \( M \) of the fiber.


**** Covariant derivatives and exterior derivatives.
We recall that a *covariant derivative* or a *connection* \( \tilde\nabla \) of \( E \) is uniquely determined in a
local coordinates by an \( m\times m \) matrix \( A \) of 1-form on \( M \), in other
words an 1-form on \( M \) with value in \( Hom_M(E,E) \) which depends on the local frame
of \( E \) (i.e. \( A \) is not a tensor with value in \( E \)). \( A \) is called the
*connection form* of \( \tilde \nabla \). Locally
\[
 \tilde\nabla_X (s^\alpha \tilde e_\alpha) = (\nabla_X s^\alpha) \tilde e_\alpha +
A^\alpha_\beta(X)s^\beta\tilde e_\alpha.
\]



When one prefers to work with forms other than tensors with value in \( E \), one uses an
*exterior derivative*, a map \( D: A^p(M,E) \longrightarrow A^{p+1}(M,E) \) which turns an
\( p \)-form with value in \( E \) to an \( p+1 \)-form with value in \( E \). Locally 
\[
 D (s^\alpha \tilde e_\alpha) = (d s^\alpha) \tilde e_\alpha +
A^\alpha_\beta\wedge s^\beta\tilde e_\alpha.
\]
and 
\[
 D^2(s^\alpha \tilde e_\alpha = (dA + A\wedge A)\wedge s.
\]
One notes \( \Theta := dA + A\wedge A \), which is an \( m\times m \) matrix of 2-forms of
\( M \). Unlike \( A \), \( \Theta \), seen as an 2-form with value in \( Hom_M(E,E) \)
does not depend on the local frame of \( E \), i.e. \( \Theta \) transforms as a (0,2)
tensor with value in \( E \), called the *curvature form*.



The fibrewise metric structure of \( E \) and the metric tensor of \( M \) give rise to a pointwise inner product of
\((p,q) \) tensors of \( M \) with value in \( E \), in particular a pointwise inner
product \( (s, s')\mapsto s\cdot s' \) from \( A^p(M,E)\times A^p(M,E) \) to \( C^\infty(M) \). Integrated over \( M \), the pointwise inner product gives rise
to a global inner product \( \langle  \cdot,\cdot \rangle  \), i.e. a true inner product of \( A^p(M,E) \). One denotes by
\( \delta: A^{p+1}(M,E)\longrightarrow A^p(M,E) \) the adjoint operator of
\( D: A^p(M,E) \longrightarrow A^{p+1}(M,E) \) with respect to this inner product, i.e.
\( \langle Ds, s' \rangle_{A^{p+1}(M,E)} = \langle s, \delta s' \rangle_{A^{p}(M,E)}\) for
all \( s\in A^{p}(M,E), s'\in A^{p+1}(M,E) \).



**** Laplacian operator and harmonic forms.
The *Laplacian operator* is defined as a endomorphism of \( A^p(M,E) \) given by
\[
 \tilde \Delta = -(D\delta +\delta D)
\]
and a form \( s\in A^p(M,E) \) is called *harmonic* if \( \tilde\Delta s=0 \). Since the
Laplacian operator represents the /Dirichlet integral/, i.e.
\[
 \langle Ds, Ds' \rangle + \langle \delta s, \delta s' \rangle = \langle -\tilde\Delta s, s' \rangle,
\]
one has \( \tilde\Delta s = 0 \) if and only if \( Ds = \delta s = 0 \).



**** Riemannian connected bundle.
The metric vector bundle \( E \) over \( M \) is called a *Riemannian-connected bundle* if
it has a connection \( \tilde \nabla \) under which the metric \( g' \) of \( E \) is
parallel, i.e. \( \tilde\nabla g' = 0 \), in other words, the matrix \( A \) in a
orthonormal frame is anti-symmetric: \( A + \transp{A} = 0 \). Unless explicitly
indicated, we always suppose that our metric vector bundle \( E \) is Riemannian-connected
and the metric \( g' \) is parallel to the connection being used.

#+LATEX: \label{ex:pullback-tangent}
The case of our interest is when we have a smooth map \( f: M \longrightarrow M' \) and
\(E = f^*TM' \) is a metric vector bundle over \( M \) under the metric \( g' \) induced
from \( M' \). Taking the connection \( \tilde\nabla \) to be the Levi-Civita connection \( \nabla' \)
on \( M' \), meaning
\[
 \tilde\nabla_X s = \nabla'_{f_*X}s,
\]
for any vector field \( s \) along \( f \), one can see that \( E \) is a
Riemannian-connected bundle over \( M \).

#+BEGIN_lemma
#+LATEX: \label{lem:calculs-general}
Let \( E \) be a Riemannian-connected bundle and \( s\in A^1(M,E) \), one has
1. \( \delta s = (\delta s)^\alpha \tilde e_\alpha \in A^0(M,E) \) where
   \[
    (\delta s)^\alpha = -g^{ij}\left(\nabla_i s^\alpha_j + A^\alpha_{\beta i} s^\beta_j \right),
   \]
2. \( \Delta s = (\Delta s)_i dx^i \) where \( (\Delta s)_i \) is an \( m\times m \)
   matrix given by
   \[
    (\Delta s)_i = {\tilde\nabla}^k {\tilde\nabla}_k s_i - \transp{\left(\Theta_i^h - {\rm
   Ric}_i^h\right)} s_h
   \]
   where:
   - the indices \( i,h,k \) correspond to local coordinates of \( M \), _not_ a frame of \( M' \), 
   - \( \Theta_i^h \) is the curvature form of \(\tilde\nabla \) with its
     indices raised by the metric \( g \) of \( M \),
   - \( {\rm Ric}_i^h = {\rm Ric}_i^h I_m \) is the Ricci curvature tensor of \( (M,g) \) with indices
     raised by the metric \( g \), multiplied by the identity \( m\times m \) matrix,
   - \( \tilde \nabla^k = g^{hk}\tilde\nabla_h \).
3. With \( s\cdot s' \) denoting the pointwise inner product of \( A^1(M,E) \) and \(
   \langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle \) denoting the metric \( g' \) of \( E \), one has
   \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:laplace-Q}   
    \frac{1}{2}\Delta(s\cdot s) = - s\cdot \Delta s - \langle\tilde\nabla_i s_k,\tilde\nabla^i s^k \rangle_E - \left\langle \transp{\left(\Theta_i^h - {\rm Ric}_i^h\right)}s_h, s^i\right\rangle_E

*** Energy functional and tension field
Our interest will be the case of Example ref:ex:pullback-tangent where \( E =f^*TM'\) for
some smooth map \( f: M \longrightarrow M' \) of Riemannian manifolds is a
Riemmanian-connected bundle over \( M \) with the connection \( \tilde\nabla \) given by
the Levi-Civita connection of \( M' \).

The tangent map \( Tf: TM \longrightarrow TM' \) can be interpreted as a form \( f_* \) in
\( A^1(M, E) \). The energy functional can be rewritten as
\[
 E(f) = \frac{1}{2}\int_M f^\alpha_i f^\beta_j g^{ij}g'_{\alpha\beta}dV =\frac{1}{2}\langle f_*, f_* \rangle_{A^1{M,E}}.
\]


#+ATTR_HTML: :id prop:calculs-pullback-tangent 
#+BEGIN_proposition
#+LATEX: \label{prop:calculs-pullback-tangent}
Let \( f: M \longrightarrow M' \) and \( E = f^* TM' \) be the Riemannian-connected bundle
over \( M \). Then:
1. \( A^\beta_\alpha = \Gamma'^{\beta}_{\gamma\alpha} f_i^\gamma dx^i \) where \( \Gamma'^{\beta}_{\gamma,\alpha}
   \) are Christoffel symbols of \( (M',g') \).
2. \( Df_* = 0 \) where \( f_* \) is considered as an element of \( A^1(M,E) \). Hence \(
   \tilde\Delta f_*= -D\delta f_* \).
3. The tension field of \( f \) is \( \tau f_* = -\delta f_*\).
#+END_proposition
#+BEGIN_proof
1. We will use the fact that \( \tilde\nabla g' = 0 \). Given two section \( s=s^\alpha
   \tilde e_\alpha,t=t^\beta \tilde e_\beta \) of \( E \), expanding
   \( \nabla_i(s\cdot t) = (\tilde\nabla_i s)\cdot t +s\cdot \tilde\nabla_i t \), one has
   \[ 
   s^\alpha t^\beta \frac{\partial g'_{\alpha\beta}}{\partial x^i} = s^\alpha t^\beta
   \left( A^\gamma_{\alpha i} g'_{\gamma\beta} + A^\gamma_{\beta i} g'_{\alpha\gamma}\right)
   \]
   Taking \( s,t \) to be of small support, \( \alpha=\beta \) and substituing \(
   A^\gamma_{\alpha i} = \Gamma'^\nu_{\gamma\alpha}f^\gamma_i \), one obtains the first statement.
2. By direct computation:
   \[
    D f_* = \left(\frac{\partial^2 f^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j} +
   \Gamma'^\alpha_{\gamma\beta} f^\gamma_i f^\beta_j \right)dx^j\wedge dx^i\otimes
   \tilde e_\alpha, 
   \]
   which is the product of a symmetric quantity in \( (i,j) \) and an anti-symmetric one,
   hence 0.
3. Using the first part of Lemma ref:lem:calculs-general for \( s=f_* = f^\alpha_i dx^i\otimes
   \tilde e_\alpha \), one has \( \delta f_* = -g^{ij}\left(\nabla_i\nabla_j f^\gamma +
   \Gamma'^\gamma_{\alpha\beta} f^\alpha_i f^\beta_j\right)\tilde e_\gamma=-\tau(f) \)

*** Fundamental form, some results in case of signed curvature

#+BEGIN_definition
The *fundamental form* of a map \( f: M \longrightarrow M' \) of Riemannian manifolds is
the (0,2) symmetric tensor on \( M  \) with value in \( E=f^* TM' \) defined by
\[

f^\alpha_i f^\beta_j\right) dx^i\otimes dx^j\otimes \tilde e_\gamma.

#+END_remark

When \( s = f_* \), Lemma ref:lem:calculs-general and Remark ref:rem:calculs-general
become, with no more than direct computation. The appearance of the Riemann curvature
tensor \( R' \) of \( (M',g') \) is due to the formula
\[ R'^\rho{}_{\sigma\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu\Gamma'^\rho{}_{\nu\sigma} -
\partial_\nu\Gamma'^\rho{}_{\mu\sigma} +
\Gamma'^\rho{}_{\mu\lambda}\Gamma'^\lambda{}_{\nu\sigma} -

#+END_lemma

The previous computation of \( Q(f_*) \) in term of Riemannian curvature of \( M' \) and
Ricci curvature of \( M \) give the following result in the case where the curvature of \(

**** Notation.
Given a Riemannian manifold \( M \), we will use the following notation:
1. \( {\rm Ric} \geq 0 \) (resp. \( {\rm Ric} > 0 \)) if the Ricci curvature is positive
   semi-definite (resp. positive definite) as symmetric bilinear form.
2. \( {\rm Ric} \leq 0 \) (resp. \( {\rm Ric} < 0 \)) if \( -{\rm Ric} \geq 0 \) (resp. \( -{\rm Ric} > 0 \)).
3. \( {\rm Riem}\geq 0 \) (resp. \( {\rm Riem} > 0 \)) if the Riemann curvature tensor satisfies \( R_{ijhk} u^{ij}
   u^{hk}\geq C(P)u_{ij}u^{ij}\) at \( P\in M \) for all anti-symmetric (2,0) tensor \( u
   \) on \( M \), where \( C(P)\geq 0 \) (resp. \( C(P) >0 \))
4. \( {\rm Riem} \leq 0 \) (resp. \( {\rm Riem} < 0 \)) if \( -{\rm Riem} \geq 0 \) (resp. \( -{\rm Riem} > 0 \)).

For 3), if \( {\rm Ric}(M)<0 \) at one point \( P\in M \) then at that point \( f^\alpha_i dx^i \tilde
e_\alpha =0 \), meaning \( f_*=0 \), hence \( e(f) \) vanishes at \( P \). Since \( e(f)
\) has to be constant, it vanishes identically, which implies that \( f \) is constant.

If \( {\rm Riem}(M') <0 \), one has \(  f_i^\alpha f^\beta_j \tilde e_\alpha\otimes \tilde
  e_\beta\) is symmetric, i.e. \( f^\alpha_i f^\beta_j = f^\alpha_j f^\beta_i \) for all
  \( i,j,\alpha,\beta \), meaning that the ratio \( f^\alpha_i: f^\alpha_j \) is
  independent of \( \alpha \), i.e. \( (\nabla f^\alpha)_{\alpha\in \overline{1,m}} \) are
  colinear, i.e. the image of \( Tf \) is of one dimension, which leads to the conclusion,
  as we will see later that a totally geodesic map transform geodesic to geodesic.

** Example: Riemannian immersion
Let \( f: M \longrightarrow M' \) be a Riemannian immersion, i.e. \( Tf \) is injective and \( f^*g' = g \). We will
see that the fundamental form \( \beta(f) \) that we defined earlier is the same as how it
is often defined in courses of Riemannian geometry.
*** Second fundamental form.
One defines the symmetric (0,2)-tensor \( \sff \) as the unique tangent vector of \( M' \) such that
\[
\langle \sff_{ij},\xi_\sigma \rangle= -\langle \tilde\nabla_i\xi_\sigma, f_* e_j\rangle
\]
for every vector field \( \xi_\sigma \) of \( M' \) orthogonal to \( M \).

#+LATEX: \label{lem:second-fund-form}
If \( f \) is a Riemannian immersion then \( \beta(f)_{ij} = \sff_{ij}  \) and they are orthogonal
to \( M \).
In particular, if \( f \) is totally geodesic than it maps geodesics of \( M \) to
geodesics of \( M' \)
#+END_lemma
#+BEGIN_proof
One has
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:second-fund-form}
\begin{split}
\langle \tilde\nabla_i\xi_\sigma, f_* e_j)\rangle &= \langle\xi_\sigma, \tilde\nabla_i (f_* e_j)\rangle
				      		  = \langle \xi_\sigma,\tilde\nabla_i(f^\gamma_l dx^l\otimes \tilde e_\gamma) e_j + f_* \nabla_i e_j \rangle\\
						  &= \langle \xi_\sigma, (f^\gamma_{il} dx^l\tilde e_\gamma + f^\gamma_l dx^l \tilde\nabla_i\tilde e_\gamma) e_j \rangle\\
						  &= \langle \xi_\sigma, f^\gamma_{ij} \tilde e_\gamma + f^\gamma_j A^\alpha_{\gamma_i}\tilde e_\alpha \rangle
						   = \left\langle \xi_\sigma,  \left(f^\gamma_{ij} + \Gamma'^\gamma_{\alpha\beta} f^\alpha_i f^\beta_j \right)\tilde e_\gamma \right\rangle = \langle\xi_\sigma\tilde\nabla_i(f_*).e_j \rangle
\end{split}   
\end{equation}
where we used \( \xi_\sigma \perp f_* e_j \) in the first reduction and \( \xi_\sigma
\perp f_*([e_i, e_j] \) in the second one. Hence \( \sff_{ij} \equiv \beta(f)_{ij} \) modulo an element in \( TM \). In fact one has
\( \beta(f)_{ij}\perp M \) and therefore \( \sff = \beta(f) \), since \( \beta(f)_{ij} =
\tilde \nabla_i (f_*). e_j \) and
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\langle \beta(f)_{ij}, f_* e_k \rangle &= \langle\tilde \nabla_i (f_*). e_j, f_* e_k
\rangle = \tilde\nabla_i \langle f_* e_j, f_* e_k \rangle - \langle  \nabla_i e_j, e_k \rangle -
\langle  f_*e_j, \tilde\nabla_i(f_* e_k) \rangle  \\
&=-\langle \beta(f)_{ik}, f_* e_j \rangle + \nabla_i \langle e_j,e_k \rangle - \langle
\nabla_i e_j, e_k \rangle - \langle e_j, \nabla_i e_k \rangle\\ &= -\langle \beta(f)_{ik}, f_* e_j \rangle
\end{split}   
\end{equation}
Then using the symmetric of \( \beta(f)_{ij} \), one has \( \langle \beta(f)_{ij}, f_* e_k
\rangle=0 \).

Finally, if \( \beta(f)=0 \) and \( X \) is a geodesic vector field of \( M \), one needs
to prove that \( f_*X \) is a geodesic vector field of \( M' \). In fact
\[
 \tilde\nabla_{X}(f_* X) = (\tilde\nabla_X f_*) X + f_*\nabla_X X = \beta(f)(X,X) = 0.
\]
Hence \( f_* X \) is a geodesic field of \( M' \).

** Example: Riemannian submersion
*** Results of Ehresmann and Hermann.
In this section, the function \( f: M \longrightarrow M' \) will be a Riemannian submersion \( pi: M \longrightarrow B \), i.e. \( T\pi \) is subjective and \( \pi^*g' = g \). We will
regard \( \pi \) as a fibration and calculate its tension field. We start with two theorem
of Hermann with cite:besse_einstein_2007 as reference. A tangent vector of \( M \) lying
in \( \ker T_P\pi \) is said to be *vertical*. Since \( \pi^* g' = g \), the plane \(
\mathcal{H}_P = \ker T_P\pi \) is isometric to \( T_{\pi(P)}B \) and is said to be
*horizontal*, such \( \mathcal{H}_P \) form a distribution of planes as \( P \) varies in
\( M \).

#+BEGIN_definition
The plane distribution \( \mathcal{H} \) is called *complete* if every curve \( \gamma \) in \( B \)
lifts horizontally on \( M \) at each point \( P \) in \( M_{\gamma(0)} \), i.e. there exists a curve \( \hat \gamma \) in \( M \)
such that \( \pi\circ\hat\gamma = \gamma \) and \( \hat\gamma(0)=P\in M \).

A vector field \( X \) of \( M \) is said to be *projectable* if \( \pi_* X \) is
well-defined, i.e. \( \pi_* X \) does not change on each fibre.  In that case, one says that \( X \) is *\(
\pi \)-associated* to the vector field \( \pi_* X \) of \( B \).

\( X \) is said to be *basic* if it is projectable and horizontal.  
#+END_definition

#+BEGIN_remark
If a vector field \( X \) on \( M \) is \( \pi \)-associated with a vector field \(
   \check X \) on \( B \), then
1. their flows are related by \( \pi \): \( \pi(\Phi_X^t)
   = \Phi_{\check X}^t \),
2. the Lie bracket satisfies: \( [X,Y] \) is projectable and \( \pi \)-associated with \(

1. The trivialising map \( \phi: U_M \longrightarrow U_B\times F\), where \( U_M, U_B \) are
   open set of \( M,B \), is only a diffeomorphism and not a isometry, each fibre is equipped
   with different metric when identified with \( F \).
2. The metric of \( M \) is not a Riemannian product of a (vertical) metric on \( F \)
   and the (horizontal) metric on \( B \), but it is a product pointwise. To be precise,
   one has
   \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:g-product}
    g_{(b,f)}(v_h^1 + v_v^1, v_h^2 + v_v^2) = g'_b(v^1_h, v^2_h)\times \hat{g}_{(b,f)}(v_v^1, v_v^2)   
   \end{equation}
   where \( v^i = v_h^i + v_v^i \) is the decomposition of vector \( v^i \) to horizontal and vertical components.
   \( g' \) is the horizontal metric (the metric on \( M \)) and \( \hat g_{(b,f)} \) is
   the restriction of \( g \) on the fibre \( M_b \). However, when the fibration is of
   totally geodesic fibres, \( g \) is a Riemannian product \( g_{(b,f)} = g'_b\times \hat
   g_f\), see Theorem ref:thm-Hermann.
#+END_remark

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Sketch of proof]
#+BEGIN_proof
The first part is due to Ehresmann, take a small geodesic ball center at \( P \), and connect every point
\( Q \) to \( P \) by a curve \( \gamma \). Map every point \(\hat \gamma(0)\in M_P \)
to the point \( \hat\gamma(1)\in M_Q \) where \( \hat\gamma \) is the lift of
\( \gamma \) starting from \( \hat\gamma(0) \). One has a diffeomorphism \(
\theta_\gamma: M_{\gamma(0)} \longrightarrow M_{\gamma(1)} \).

The second part, due to Hermann, can be established in 2 steps:

First, by direct computation, one proves that if any geodesic field \( X \) on \( B \) lift to a horizontal
vector field \( \hat X \) then \( \hat X \) is a geodesic vector field. In fact, denote by
\( \nabla \) and \( \tilde\nabla \) the Levi-Civita connection on \( M \) and \( B \)
respectively and \( \mathcal{V}, \mathcal{H} \) the vertical and horizontal projection of
tangent vectors of \( M \). Then \(\nabla_{\hat X}\hat X = \mathcal{V}\nabla_{\hat X}\hat X + \mathcal{H}\nabla_{\hat
X}\hat X\) in which \( \mathcal{H}\nabla_{\hat X}\hat X \) is actually the horizontal
lift of \( \tilde\nabla_X X \) therefore vanishes. We claim that \( \mathcal{V}\nabla_{Y}Y = \frac{1}{2}\mathcal{V}[Y,Y]\) hence also vanishes for every basic vector field \( Y \). In fact let \( U \) be any
vertical vector field then
\[
\langle U, \mathcal{V}\nabla_{Y}Y \rangle = \langle U,\nabla_Y Y \rangle = - \langle
\nabla_X U, X \rangle= \langle \nabla_U X, X \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\nabla_U \langle X,X \rangle=0
\]
where we used the fact that \(  \)\( \nabla_X U -\nabla_U X = [X,U] = \widehat{[\pi_*
X,\pi_* U]} = 0 \) and \( \langle X, X \rangle \) is constant on each fibre (being \(\langle
\pi_* X,\pi_* X \rangle \)), hence in
every vertical direction \( U \) (Remark: this corresponds to the fact that \( g' \) only depend
on \( b \)).

Now if \( M \) is complete then for every geodesic curve \( \gamma \)
in \( B \), let \( X \) be the velocity field of \( \gamma \) and \( \hat X \) be the
horizontal lift of \( X \), which is now a horizontal,geodesic field of \( M \), whose
integral curves are lifts of \(\gamma \). Therefore \( B \) is complete and every geodesic curve of \( B \) lifts horizontally to \( M \).

For the general curve \( \gamma \) of \( M \), the idea will be to approximate it by
geodesics and lift part by part.

If the fibration \( \pi: M \longrightarrow B \) is

Riemannian product of \( B \) and the fibre, now equipped with its unique
metric induced by \( M \).
#+END_theorem

#+BEGIN_proof
We need to prove that the metric on fibres \( \hat g_{(b,f)} \) does not depend on the point
\( f \) of the fibre, i.e. for every basic vecotr field \( X \), one has \(
\mathcal{L}_X\hat g=0 \), where by \( \hat g \), we mean the (0,2) symmetric tensor \( (Y_1, Y_2)\mapsto \langle
\mathcal{V}Y_1, \mathcal{V}Y_2 \rangle \). Let \( U,V \) be vertical vector fields of \( M \) then
\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:calcul-Hermann}
\begin{split}
X(\hat g(U,V)) &= (\mathcal{L}_X \hat g)(U,V) + \hat g([X,U],V) + \hat g(U, [X,V])\\
       	       &=  \langle \nabla_X U, V \rangle - \langle \nabla_U X, V \rangle + \langle U, \nabla_X V \rangle - \langle U, \nabla_V X \rangle + (\mathcal{L}_X\hat g)(U,V)
\end{split}   
\end{equation*}
Hence \( (\mathcal{L}_X \hat g)(U,V) = \langle \nabla_U X, V\rangle + \langle U, \nabla_V
X \rangle = -2 \langle \sff(U,V), X \rangle = 0\). Since the map \(
\hat\gamma(0) \mapsto \hat\gamma(1) \) is in the one-parameter group of differomorphism
associate to a basic vector field \( X \), it preserves \( \hat g \).
