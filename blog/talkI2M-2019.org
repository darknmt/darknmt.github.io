This is the note of my talk to M2 students at I2M, Marseille about second variation of
energy/length and applications. I introduce Bonnet--Myers' Theorem and give a proof of
Synge's Theorem using Weinstein's Fixed point theorem.

The reference is this [[http://math.uchicago.edu/~amathew/syngew.pdf][note]] of A. Mathew.
