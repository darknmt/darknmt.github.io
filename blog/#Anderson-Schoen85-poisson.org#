This is my reading note of cite:anderson_positive_1985. The Dirichlet problem for harmonic
function on negatively curved space was solved during 1984-1985 by 4 different
mathematicians starting from Anderson using Perron's method and Sullivan using random
walk, then later by Schoen and Mazzeo. This article gives a Poisson type representation
of the solution.

Recall that Poisson representation gives the solution of harmonic function \( u \) on the
disk with prescribed boundary value \( f \) as
\[
 u(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\partial B}f(\xi)P(x,\xi) d\xi,\qquad P(x,\xi):= \frac{1 - |x|^2}{|x-\xi|^2}
\]
Since harmonicity is conformal in 2D, this gives a solution to harmonic equation on \(
\mathbb{H}^2 \) with prescribed value at infinity. The problem for \( \mathbb{H}^n \) with \(
n>2 \) is not more complicated, as one knows its isometry group. See
Joel's note for details.

On a general Cartan--Hadamard manifold, i.e. manifold with sectional curvatures \( -b^2 <
K < -a^2 \), the idea is to construct the analog \( K_\xi(x) \) of \( P(x,\xi) \) as a positive harmonic function that
extends continuously to \( 0 \) on the sphere at infinity \( S(\infty)\setminus \{\xi\} \)
by taking the limit (upto subsequence) of the normalised Green's kernel
\(
 h_i(x) = \frac{G(y_i,x)}{G(y_i, 0)}
\). One can see that \( \{h_i\} \) subconverges in the interior using Harnack's
inequality. This article carries out the extra analysis to guarantee behavior at
infinity.

It turns out that the Poisson kernels \( K_\xi \) are unique and any harmonic function \(
u \) is a combination of \( K_\xi \), i.e.
\(
 u = \int_{S(\infty)}K_\xi d\mu
\) for a certain positive Borel measure \( \mu \) on \( S(\infty) \)

Note that we do not need continuity of \( u \) upto boundary in the representation. 
A bonus of this is that behavior at infinity of \( u \) could not be complicated than \(
K_\xi \). In particular, it was proved that \( u \) is /non-tangentially continuous/ at
almost all points of \( S(\infty) \).
