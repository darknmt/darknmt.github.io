* Sheaf and Presheaf
#+BEGIN_definition
Let $M$ be a manifold, a *sheaf* over $M$ is a couple $(\mathcal{S}, \pi)$ with $
\mathcal{S}$ a topologized space and $\pi: \mathcal{S}\longrightarrow M$ a _local
homeomorphism_ such that each *stalk* \( \pi^{-1}(m) \) is a \(R\)-module.

A *presheaf* is a way to associate each open set $U\subset M$ a \( R \)-module \(
\mathcal{S}(U) \) and morphisms \( \iota_{V,U}: \mathcal{S}(U) \longrightarrow
\mathcal{S}(V)\) which satisfy cocycle condition.
#+END_definition

#+BEGIN_remark
1. In spirit, by _taking section_ and _taking germ_ (direct limit) the two objects are the
   same. Technically, in order to obtain an equivalent condition, one has to restrict to
   presheaves that satisfy: For every covering \( \{U_i\} \) of \( U \)
   1. $f=g$ in \( \mathcal{S}(U) \) if and only if \( \iota_{U_i, U} f = \iota_{U_i, U} g
      \) for every $i$.
   2. For every family \( f_i \in \mathcal{S}(U_i) \) that satisfies \( \iota_{U_i\cap
      U_j, U_i}f_i = \iota_{U_j\cap U_i, U_j}f_j \) there exists an \( f \in
      \mathcal{S}(U) \) such that \( \iota_{U_i,U} f = f_i \).
2. Usual operation on modules can be extend to sheaves. The tensor product, for example,
   can be defined on presheaves then pass to sheaves (in order not to deal with the
   topology)

* Cohomology of complexes

** Construction and naturality
  A *complex* is a sequence \( C_0 \longrightarrow C_1 \longrightarrow \dots \longrightarrow C_n
\longrightarrow \dots \) such that the composition of two consecutive arrows vanishes. The
cohomology \( H^n(C_*) \) is defined by \( H^n(C_*) = \ker d_{n}/ \im d_{n-1} \).

** Multiplicative structure
Given two complexes \( \{C_*\},\{D_*\} \), one can define their tensor product as \( E_* =
C_* \otimes D_* \) with
\[
0 \longrightarrow C_0\otimes D_0 \longrightarrow (C_0\otimes D_1) \oplus (C_1\otimes D_0)
\longrightarrow \dots

#+END_theorem



* Axiomatic cohomology theory
Let $M$ be a manifold, a *cohomology theory* on $M$ is a _functor_ from the _category of
sheaves over $M$_ to the _category of graded \( R \)-module_ such that
1. Each sheaf \( \mathcal{S} \) corresponds to a graded module sequence \(
   H^n(M,\mathcal{S}) \) with \( H^0(M,\mathcal{S}) = \Gamma(S) \) the module of global
   sections of \( \mathcal{S} \) and \( H^{n}(M, \mathcal{S}) = 0 \) if \( n<0
   \). Morphisms between sheaves are transformed to morphisms between cohomology.
2. Any short exact sequence \( 0 \longrightarrow \mathcal{S}' \longrightarrow \mathcal{S}
   \longrightarrow \mathcal{S}'' \longrightarrow 0\) gives rise to a long exact sequence
   \[
   \dots \longrightarrow H^n(M, \mathcal{S}') \longrightarrow H^n(M, \mathcal{S}) \longrightarrow H^n(M,
   \mathcal{S}'') \longrightarrow H^{n+1}(M, \mathcal{S}') \longrightarrow \dots
   \] 
   One also has the naturality for such long sequence, i.e. for the coboundary map \(
   H^n(M, \mathcal{S}'') \longrightarrow H^n(M, \mathcal{S}') \).
3. Cohomology of a fine sheaf is 0.

A sheaf \( \mathcal{S} \) is called *fine* if for every locally finite open cover \( U_i
\) of \( M \), there exists automorphisms \( f_i \) of \( \mathcal{S} \) such that \(
\supp f_i \subset U_i \) and \( \sum f_i = Id_\mathcal{S} \).


** Existence and Uniqueness
The next theorem will give a cohomology theory given that one has a *resolution*, i.e. an
exact sequence 
\[
0 \longrightarrow K \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}_0 \longrightarrow
\mathcal{C}_1 \longrightarrow \dots 
\] 
where \( K \) is the constant sheaf \( M\times R\). Such a resolution does exist, the most
natural one may be the de Rham resolution, which gives de Rham cohomology that we will
discuss later. 

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Existence of cohomolgy theory]
#+ATTR_HTML: :id thm:existence-cohomology :btit (Existence of cohomology theory) 
#+BEGIN_theorem
#+LATEX: \label{thm:existence-cohomology}
Let \( \mathcal{C}_* \) be a resolution of $M$, then the cohomology of the following
complex
\[
0 \longrightarrow \Gamma(\mathcal{C}_0 \otimes \mathcal{S}) \longrightarrow
\Gamma(\mathcal{C}_1 \otimes \mathcal{S}) \longrightarrow \dots
\]
for an arbitary sheaf \( \mathcal{S} \) is a cohomology theory.
#+END_theorem

It worths mentioning that the intuition behind such construction is the half-exactness of
operations \( \mathcal{A} \mapsto \mathcal{A}\otimes \mathcal{S} \) and \(
\mathcal{A}\mapsto \Gamma(A) \). For example, one can show, using the following exactness,
that fine sheaves are of trivial cohomology.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
#+ATTR_HTML: :id lem:exactness :btit 
#+BEGIN_lemma
#+LATEX: \label{lem:exactness}
1. "Tensoring" functor is right exactness, i.e. a short exact sequence \( 0 \longrightarrow
   \mathcal{C}' \longrightarrow \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}'' \longrightarrow
   0 \) induces
   \[
   \mathcal{C}'\otimes \mathcal{T} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}\otimes \mathcal{T}
   \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}''\otimes \mathcal{T} \longrightarrow 0.
   \]
   Moreover, if \( \mathcal{C}'' \) or \(\mathcal{T}\) is torsionless, one has
   \[
   0 \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}'\otimes \mathcal{T} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}\otimes \mathcal{T}
   \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}''\otimes \mathcal{T} \longrightarrow 0.
   \]
2. $\Gamma$ fuctor is left exact, i.e. a short exact sequence \( 0 \longrightarrow
   \mathcal{C}' \longrightarrow \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}'' \longrightarrow
   0 \) induces
   \[
   0 \longrightarrow \Gamma(\mathcal{C}') \longrightarrow \Gamma(\mathcal{C}) \longrightarrow \Gamma(\mathcal{C}'').
   \]
   Moreover, if \( \mathcal{C}'\) is fine then
   \[
   0 \longrightarrow \Gamma(\mathcal{C}') \longrightarrow \Gamma(\mathcal{C})
   \longrightarrow \Gamma(\mathcal{C}'') \longrightarrow 0.
   \]
3. If \( \mathcal{S} \) or \( \mathcal{T} \) is fine, then \( \mathcal{S}\otimes
   \mathcal{T} \) is fine.
#+END_lemma


One might note that such a cohomology depends a priori on the resolution \( \mathcal{C}_*
\), the following result claims that in fact any resolution gives the same theory.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Uniqueness of cohomology theory]
#+ATTR_HTML: :btit (Uniqueness of cohomology theory) :id thm:uniqueness-cohomology
#+BEGIN_theorem
#+LATEX: \label{thm:uniqueness-cohomology}
Any two cohomology theory \( \mathcal{H}, \tilde{\mathcal{H}} \) has \( \#Func(\mathcal{H},
\tilde{\mathcal{H}}) =1 \), therefore the two are naturally isomorphic.
#+END_theorem


#+BEGIN_remark
+A consequence of uniqueness of cohomology theory is the following.+ From the construction
in Theorem ref:thm:existence-cohomology, given a sheaf \(
\mathcal{S} \) of \( R_2 \)module and \( R_1 \) is a subring of \( R_2 \) then the
cohomology \( H^*(M, \mathcal{S}) \) of \( \mathcal{S} \) can be defined in the category
of \( R_1 \)-sheaves or \( R_2 \)-sheaves, noted by the \( R_i \)-modules \( H^*(M,
\mathcal{S})_{R_i} \). Then \(H^*(M, \mathcal{S})_{R_2}\) is isomorphic to \( H^*(M,
\mathcal{S})_{R_1} \) as \( R_1 \)-modules.

By this reason, the base ring \( R \) is not expressed explicitly in the notation \(
H^*(M, \mathcal{S}) \).
#+END_remark


It is straight-forward to see that the computation of cohomology is much simplified if one
can find a *fine resolution* \( \mathcal{C}_n \) of \( \mathcal{S} \), i.e. fine sheaves
\( \mathcal{C}_n \) such that \( 0 \longrightarrow \mathcal{S}\longrightarrow
\mathcal{C}_0 \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}_1 \longrightarrow \dots \)

of \( \mathcal{S} \) then
\[
H^n(M, \mathcal{S}) = H^n(\Gamma(\mathcal{C}_*))
\]

Let \( M \) be a complex manifold and \( \Omega^p \) be the sheaf of holomorphic \( p
\)-forms, i.e. form that are locally \( \sum_{|I|=p} h_I(z)dz^I \) with \( h_I \)
holomorphic. The Dolbeault-Grothendieck lemma gives us exactly the following resolution of
\( \Omega^p \): \[ 0 \longrightarrow \Omega^p \longrightarrow \Omega^{p,0} \longrightarrow
\Omega^{p,1} \longrightarrow \dots \] where \( \Omega^{p,q} \) are sheaves of \( C^\infty
\) forms of type \( (p,q) \). Theorem ref:thm:fine-resolution gives \[ H^q(M,\Omega^p) =
H^q(\Gamma(\Omega^{p,*})) =: H^{p,q}_{\bar \partial}(M), \] called _Dolbeault cohomology_ of
\( M \)
#+END_exampl

** Multiplicative structure

If each stalk \( \mathcal{S}(x) \) is more than an \( R \)-module but an \( R
\)-algebra, then one can endow \( H^n(M, \mathcal{S}) \) with a multiplicative structure
that it a graded algebra. This structure come from the tensor product of the complex \(
\Gamma(\mathcal{C}_n\otimes S) \) with itself and from the natural inclusion
\[
\Gamma(\mathcal{C}_p\otimes\mathcal{S}) \otimes \Gamma(\mathcal{C}_q\otimes\mathcal{S})
\longrightarrow \Gamma(\mathcal{C}_{p+q} \otimes \mathcal{S}).
\]
which give \( H^p(M,\mathcal{S})\otimes H^q(M, \mathcal{S}) \longrightarrow H^{p+q}(M,
\mathcal{S}) \).


** Examples: de Rham cohomology
  Taking \( \mathcal{C_n} = \Omega^n(M) \) the sheaves of germs of \( n \)-forms on \( M
  \), then by Theorem ref:thm:fine-resolution one obtains the *de Rham cohomology* \( H^n(M,
  \mathbb{R}\). By the same way, one can construct *Alexander–Spanier cohomology* and
  *singular cohomology*.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [de Rham]

#+BEGIN_theorem
#+LATEX: \label{thm:de-rham-singular}
The unique natural transformation from de Rham cohomology to singular cohomology is given
by \( \omega_n \mapsto \left(\Delta_n \mapsto \int_{\Delta_n}\omega_n \right) \) and sends
the wedge product in de Rham cohomology to cup-product in singular cohomology.
#+END_theorem

* Čech cohomology
Čech cohomology is another important cohomology whose construction is not based on a
resolution. Čech cohomology \( \check{H}(M, \mathcal{S}) \) is defined as the direct limit
of the following \( \check{H}(M,\mathcal{S},\mathcal{U}) \) when \( \mathcal{U} \) becomes
finer as an open cover of \( M \).

Let \( \mathcal{U} \) be an open cover of \( M \). A \( n \)-cocyle in \( C_{n,\mathcal{U}} \) is defined as a
mapping 
\[ 
\sigma: (U_0,\dots, U_n) \mapsto \sigma(U_0,\dots, U_n) \in \mathcal{S}\left(\cap_{i=0}^n
U_i\right)
\]
and the coboundary \( d\sigma \in C_{n+1,\mathcal{U}} : (U_0,\dots, U_{n+1}) \mapsto
\sum_i \iota_{\cap U_i}(-1)^i
\sigma (U_0,\dots,\check{U_i},\dots, U_{n+1}) \). The cohomology of this complex is noted
as \( \check{H}^*(M, \mathcal{S},\mathcal{U}) \).

#+BEGIN_remark
Let \( \mathcal{V} \) be a finer cover of \( M \), i.e. every open \( V_i \) in \(
\mathcal{V} \) is included in an element \( U_{j_i} \) of \( \mathcal{U} \), there exists
a natural map \( \check{H}^*(M, \mathcal{S},\mathcal{V}) \longrightarrow \check{H}^*(M,
\mathcal{S},\mathcal{U}) \) induced by the \( C_{n,\mathcal{V}} \longrightarrow
C_{n,\mathcal{U}} \) which depends on the refining map \( j \). Using Theorem
ref:thm:prism-operator, one can prove that the induced map between cohomology is however
independent of \( j \).
#+END_remark

To actually use Čech cohomology, one needs to get rid of the direct limit, very often with
the following theorem, the [[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1897164/leray-theorem-for-acyclic-covering][proof]] of which uses the notion of flasque sheaf and 5-lemma.

\restr{\mathcal{S}}{V})=0 \) then
\[

** Example: Picard group
   Let \( X \) be a complex manifold. A vector bundle of \( X \) is called *holomorphic*
   iff the projection map is holomorphic. 
#+BEGIN_remark
A holomorphic vector bundle is different from a vector bundle with holomorphic transition
functions. In 1 dimension for example, an (differential) isomorphic class of line bundle with holomorphic
transition can be encoded as an element of \( H^1(X, \mathbb{C}) \). Meanwhile, an
(complex) isomorphic class of holomorphic line bundle is an element of \( H^1(X, \mathcal{O}^*) \).
#+END_remark


#+BEGIN_definition
The *Picard group* \( \text{Pic}(X) \) is the commutative group of holomorphic line
bundles over \( X \) with the tensor product. Another way to regard \( \text{Pic}(X) \) is
by \( \text{Pic}(X) = \check{H}^1(X, \mathcal{O}^*) \).
#+END_definition



   
** Example: first Chern class in $H^2(X, \mathbb{Z})$
   The following short exact sequence of \( \mathbb{Z} \)-module
\[
0 \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z} \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_X \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_X^*
\longrightarrow 0
\]
gives the long exact sequence:
\[
H^1(X, \mathcal{O}_X) \longrightarrow H^1(X, \mathcal{O}_X^*) \longrightarrow H^2(X,
\mathbb{Z}) \longrightarrow \dots
\]
Since $H^1(X, \mathcal{O}_X^*)$ is Picard group, the _first Chern class_ $c_1(L)$ of a
holomorphic line bundle $L$ is the image of $L$ in $H^2(X, \mathbb{Z})$.

** Example: from divisor to Picard group

An *analytic subvariety* \( Y \) of a complex manifold \( X \) is a closed set such that
locally at each \( y\in Y \), \( Y \) is zero of a holomorphic function.

#+BEGIN_remark
A analytic hypersurface \( Y \) can be completely encoded by a family \( ( U_i, f_i) \)
where \( f_i\) is a meromorphic function on \( U_i \) with \( U_i\cap Y \) its zeros. The
latter is a global section of \( H^1(X, K^*_X/ \mathcal{O}^*_X) \) where \( K_X^* \)
denotes the sheaf of meromorphic germs that is not the zero germ and \( \mathcal{O}_X^* \)
denotes the sheaf of holomorphic germs that is non-zero _at every point_
(invertible). These are sheaves of \( \mathbb{Z} \)-modules.
#+END_remark

This correspondance is not one-to-one, as \( 2.s = s^2 \in H^1(X, K^*_X/\mathcal{O}_X^*)
\) describe the same hypersurface. This phenomenon can be avoid with the notion of
divisor.

#+BEGIN_definition
An *irreducible hypersurface* of \( X \) is a analytic hypersurface that is not union of
smaller analytic hypersurfaces.

A *divisor* \( D \) on \( X \) is a formal sum \( D = \sum a_i Y_i \) where \( a_i\in
\mathbb{Z} \) and \( Y_i \) is an irreducible hypersurface. \( D \) is called *effective*
if and only if \( a_i \geq 0 \).

Let \( f \) be a meromorphic function on \( X \), the *principal divisor* associated to \(
f \) is defined by \( (f) = \sum \ord_{f,Y}Y \) where \( \ord \) denotes the order of \( f
\) on an irreducible hypersurface \( Y \)
#+END_definition

Note that an irreducible hypersurface \( Y \) does not necessarily induce irreducible
germs in every point, but only almost all points (denoted by \( Y_{reg} \)). Therefore, one
can still define the order \( ord_{f,Y} \) of a meromorphic function \( f \) on \( Y \) as
the order in any regular points.

The next theorem follows immediately from the above discussion.
#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Divisor-Line bundle relation]
#+ATTR_HTML: :id thm:div-pic-rel :btit (Divisor-Line bundle relation) 
#+BEGIN_theorem
#+LATEX: \label{thm:div-pic-rel}
1. Given a divisor \( D = \sum a_i Y_i\), there exists a unique (isomorphic class of)
   holomorphic line bundle \( L = \mathcal{O}(D) \) such that \( D =Z(s) = \sum \ord_{s,Y} Y\), the zero with
   multiple of \( s \), where \( s \) a global section of \( L \). Given an open cover \(
   U_i \) fine enough, this line bundle is defined such that the functions \(s_i = \prod
   f_j^{\alpha_j} \) where \( Y_j = Z(f_j)\) in \( U_i \) form a global section.
2. On the other hand, given a line bundle \( L \) and any global section \( s \), there
   exists a divisor \( D \) such that \( L = \mathcal{O}(D) \).
3. One has group morphism \( \text{Div}(X) \longrightarrow \text{Pic}(X) \) whose kernel
   is the subgroup of principal divisors and every \( L\in \text{Pic}(X) \) with a
   nontrivial global section is image of an effective divisor.
#+END_theorem

The morphism \( \text{Div}(X) \longrightarrow \text{Pic}(X) \) can also be constructed by
the following short exact sequence
\[
0 \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_X^* \longrightarrow K_X^* \longrightarrow K_X^*/
\mathcal{O}_X^* \longrightarrow 0
\]
which gives the long exact sequence
\[
H^0(X,K_X^*) \longrightarrow \text{Div}(X) = H^0(K_X^*/\mathcal{O}_X^*) \longrightarrow
H^1(X, \mathcal{O}_X^*) = \text{Pic}(X) \longrightarrow \dots
\]
This shows clearly that the kernel of the above group morphism is the group of principal divisors.
