** Holomorphic line bundles and first Chern class

A _complex line bundle_ is a 2 dimensional vector bundle with a complex structure on each
fiber, i.e. each change of coordinates \( g_{ij}: U_j\cap U_i \times \mathbb{R}^2
\longrightarrow  U_i\cap U_j\times\mathbb{R}^2 \) is \( i \)-linear, i.e. \( g_{ij} \) can
be represented by a function \( U_{i}\cap U_j \longrightarrow \mathbb{C} \). 

A _holomorphic line bundle_ is a complex line bundle that is also a complex manifold with
the projection being holomorphic. In the same notation, the \( g_{ij} \) are now
holomorphic functions.

A _hermitian metric_ on a line bundle \( L \) is a positive sesquilinear form on each
fiber. To define the _Chern form_ of \( L \), let \( U \) be an open set of \( X \) over
which \( L \) is trivialized and \( s_x \) is a holomorphic section of \( L \) over \( U \) that is
non-vanishing, then one defines
\[
\omega_{L,h} = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\partial \bar \partial \log |s|_h^2
\]
which is independant of \( s \) since the ratio of two different \( s \) is in \(
\mathcal{O}^*(U) \).

#+BEGIN_remark
A Chern form is a real (1,1) form.

#+BEGIN_proposition
The set of isomorphic class of holomorphic line bundle is in one-to-one correspondance to \(
H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_X^*) \)
#+END_proposition

The proof of this fact is straightforward, but it is worth to remark that this result
convinces us that the natural mapping \( \check{H}^1(\mathcal{U},X) \longrightarrow
\check{H}^1(\mathcal{V},X)  \) where \( \mathcal{U} \) is a finer open covering than \(
\mathcal{V} \) is injective, since a line bundle is completely defined by /one/ set of
change of coordinates \( (g_{ij}) \).

Now the _Chern class_ of a holomorphic line bundle is the class of \( \omega_{L,h} \) in
\( H^2(X,\mathbb{Z}) \), which turns out to be independent of \( h \) and is in fact lies
in the image of \( H^2(X,\mathbb{Z}) \longrightarrow H^2(X,\mathbb{R}) = H^2(X, \mathbb{Z})\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}\mathbb{R} \). In fact, the class
of \( \omega_{L,h} \) can be defined using the following exact sequence:
\[
0 \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z} \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_X \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_X^* \longrightarrow 0 
\]
where the injective arrow is the multiplication by \( i2\pi\) and the surjective one is
exponential. The Chern map is in fact \( H^1(X,\mathcal{O}^*_X) \longrightarrow
H^2(X,\mathbb{Z}) \). To prove this, one uses a double complex whose horizontal is the de Rham
resolution and vertical is the ÄŒech resolution and diagram chasing.




** Divisors, line bundles and sheaves
#+BEGIN_remark
1. A holomorphic line bundle is the same as a locally free \( \mathcal{O}_X \)-module of rank 1.
2. An isomorphic class of line bundles is the same as a locally free isomorphic sheaf of \(
   \mathcal{O}_X \)-module of rank 1.

*** From divisors to Picard group
A _divisor_ is a formal sum of irreducible hypersurface, which can also be intepreted as
an element of \( \check{H}^0(X,K_X^*/\mathcal{O}_X^*) \), which gives a mapping \( Div(X)
\longrightarrow \check{H}^0(X,K_X^*/\mathcal{O}_X^*) \) with _principal divisors_ being
exactly sent to elements of \( K_X^*/\mathcal{O}_X^* \) coming from \( K_X^* \).
multiplicative).

Since the following sequence
\[
0 \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_X^* \longrightarrow K_X^* \longrightarrow K_X^*/O_X^* \longrightarrow 0
\]
is exact, one has an application \(\mathcal{O}:\ Div(X) = H^0(X, K_X^*/\mathcal{O}_X^*)
\longrightarrow  H^1(X, \mathcal{O}_X^*) = Pic(X)  \). The kernel of \( \mathcal{O} \)
corresponds to the the space of principal divisors. It is however worth having details
of the application \(\mathcal{O} \).

Let \( D = (U_i,f_i)\in Div(X) \) where \( f_i \) are meromorphic function on \( U_i \)
with \( f_i/f_j\in \mathcal{O}_X^* \), then \( \mathcal{O}(D) \) is defined as following:
\[
\mathcal{O}(D) (U_i) = f_i^{-1}\mathcal{O}_X(U_i)
\]. Note that if \( D \) is effective, i.e. \( f_i\in \mathcal{O}_X(U_i) \) then \(
\mathcal{O(D)} \) is the sheaf of holomorphic functions vanishing on \( D \).


#+BEGIN_remark
To resume, here are some basic consequence of the above discussion: If \( D \) is
effective then
1. If \( D \) is effective then \( H^0(X, \mathcal{O}(D) \ne 0 \).
2. If \( D \) is effective then \( \mathcal{O}(-D) \) is the sheaf of holomorphic
   function vanishing on \( D \). Therefore \( \mathcal{O}(-D) \) can be viewed as a
   ideal subsheaf of \( K_X \) and one has the following exact sequence: 
   \[
   0 \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}(-D) \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_X \longrightarrow
   \mathcal{O_D} \longrightarrow 0
   \]
   where \( \mathcal{O}_D \) is the sheaf of "regular functions" on \( D \).
3. If \( L \) is a holomorphic line bundle and \( 0\ne s\in H^0(X,L) \) then \(
   \mathcal{O}(Z(s)) \equiv L \)
4. If \( D \) is effective then \( \mathcal{O}(D) \) has a non-zero global section, for
   example section \( 1 = (U_i, f_i) \)
#+END_remark

*** The corresponding line bundle of \( \mathcal{O}(Y) \)

#+BEGIN_proposition
Let \( Y \) be a hypersurface of \( X \), then the line bundle \( \mathcal{O}(Y) \) is
isomorphic to \( \mathcal{N}_{Y,X} \) the normal line bundle of \( Y \) in \( X \).

By consequence, \( K_Y = \restr{(K_X\otimes \mathcal{O}(Y))}{Y} \).
#+END_proposition 



* Example: Projective space
** \( \mathcal{O}(d) \) and its sections

Let's have some examples for the point of view discussed above, starting with the torsion
sheaves \( \mathcal{O}(d) \).

The sheaf \( \mathcal{O}(-1) \), called _tautological sheaf_, is an invertible sheaf on \(
\mathbb{P}^n_{\mathbb{C}} \) such that the fiber over \( l\in \mathbb{P}^n_{\mathbb{C}}  \) of the corresponding line
bundle is \( l \) itself. Let \( l=[x_0:\dots:x_n] \ in U_i \) then a point in \( l \) is
of form \( t_i[\frac{x_0}{x_i}:,\dots:\frac{x_n}{x_i}] \) with coordinates in \( U_i \)
being \( t_i \). So the change of coordinates from chart \( U_i \) to \( U_j \) is, since
\( \frac{t_j}{x_j} = \frac{t_i}{x_i} \):
\[
g_{ji} = \frac{x_i}{x_j}
\]
One notes by \( \mathcal{O}(1) \) the dual of \( \mathcal{O}(-1) \) and \( \mathcal{O}(d)
= \mathcal{O}(1)^{\otimes d} \) and \( \mathcal{O}(-d)=\mathcal{O}(-1)^{\otimes d} \)

Now if an invertible sheaf \( \mathcal{L} \) with \( \mathcal{L}(U_i) =
\frac{1}{f_i}\mathcal{O}_X(U_i) \), the change of coordinates of the corresponding line
bundle from chart \( U_i \) to \( U_j \) is \( g_{ji} = \frac{f_j}{f_i} \). So for \(
\mathcal{O}(1) \), one has \( \frac{f_j}{f_i} = \frac{x_j}{x_i} \), i.e. there exists a
linear combination \( A \) of \( x_0,\dots, x_n \) such that \( f_i = \frac{A}{x_i} \) is
a holomorphic function correponding to the 1-section viewed in chart \( U_i \). As
presented in the previous section, *\( \mathcal{O}(1) \) is the associated line bundle of
a hyperplane defined by the equation \( A = 0 \)*.

Similarly, \( \mathcal{O}(d) \) is the associated line bundle of a hypersurface \( A_d \) defined by
a homogenous equation of degree \( d \), and \( \mathcal{O}(d) \) is the line bundle
associated to the sheaf of holomorphic functions vanishing on \( A_d \).

** Line bundles and maps to projective space, Veronese embedding

A linearly independent family \( s_0,\dots, s_N \) of global sections of a holomorphic
line bundle \( L \) defines a holomorphic map \(X\setminus Bs((s_i)) \longrightarrow
\mathbb{P}^N_{\mathbb{C}} \) where \( Bs((s_i)) \) is the set of basepoints of
\((s_i)\) where all the sections \( s_i \) vanish.

The global sections of \( \mathcal{O}(d) \) over \( \mathbb{P}^n_{\mathbb{C}} \) are
\( H^0(\mathbb{P}^n_{\mathbb{C}}, \mathcal{O}(d) = \mathbb{C}[z_0,\dots,z_n]_d \) the
vector space of homogenous polynomial of degree \( d \). The corresponding projective map
is in fact a embedding, called _Veronese embedding_.



** Canonical bundle and Euler sequence

\[
K_{\mathbb{P}^n_{\mathbb{C}} = \mathcal{O}(-n-1)}
\]

\[
0 \longrightarrow \mathcal{O} \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}(1)^{\oplus n} \longrightarrow
\mathcal{T}_{\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{C}}^n} \longrightarrow 0
\]

#+BEGIN_proposition
#+LATEX: \label{prop:adjunction}
Let \( X \) be a complex manifold, \( x\in X \) and \( \pi:\ \hat X \longrightarrow X \) is the blow-up of \( X \)
at \( x \) and \( E \) be the corresponding exceptional divisor, then
\[
K_{\hat X} = \pi^* K_X \otimes \mathcal{O}((n-1)E).
\]
As a consequence, \( \restr{\mathcal{O}(E)}{E} = \mathcal{O}(-1) \) where \(
\mathcal{O}(-1) \) is the tautologic sheaf over \( E = \mathbb{P}^{n-1}_{\mathbb{C}} \).
#+END_proposition
#+BEGIN_proof
The appearance of the number \( n-1 \) is natural and can be explained as follow. First
note that 

1. in \( \hat X\setminus E \), there is no difference between \( K_{\hat X} \) and \( K_X
   \).
2. \( \pi_* \) send every tangent vector of \( E \) to the tangent
   vector \( 0 \) at \( x\in X \),
3. the pull-back \( \pi^* \omega \)  of an \( n \)-form on \(X \) always vanishes on \( E
   \) therefore cannot generate \( K_{\hat X} \). 

Our correction of this should be dividing \( \pi^* \omega \) by \( f^k \) where \( f \) is
the equation defining \( E \) in \( \hat X \), i.e. tensoring \( \pi^* K_X \) by an
appropriate multiple of \( \mathcal{O}(E) \) depending on the order of vanishing of \(
\pi^* \omega \) at \( E \), which we claim to be \( n-1 \). 

Here is the argument I used to convince myself: this vanishing order is that of the
ratio of \( \pi^* \omega \) and a non-zero \(n \)-form (says the standard in the base
formed by \( n-1 \) tangent vectors \( e^E_i \) of \( E \) and the normal vector \( v \)
of \( E \) in \( X \)), i.e. the vanishing order of \( \pi^*\omega(e^E_i, v) \). Each \( e^E_i\) plugged
into \( \pi^*\omega \) adds one order of vanishing resulting in \( n-1 \).

Here is the argument I would use to convince others: WLOG, suppose that \( X =
\mathbb{C}^n \) and \( x=0 \), then \( \hat X \) can be seen as a subset of \(
\mathbb{C}^n\times \mathbb{P}^{n-1} \) with the coordinates in each chart \( U_i =
\left\{(x_1, \dots, x_n,[p_1:\dots:p_n]):\ p_i\ne 0\right\}\) being \(
(\frac{p_1}{p_i},\dots,\frac{p_n}{p_i},\zeta_i) \) with \( z_k = \frac{p_k}{p_i}\zeta_i
\). The map \( \pi \) is given in local coordinates as
\[
(\frac{p_1}{p_i},\dots,\frac{p_n}{p_i},\zeta_i) \mapsto (\frac{p_1}{p_i}\zeta_i, \dots
\zeta_i, \dots \frac{p_n}{p_i}\zeta_i)
\]
The pull-back of \( \omega \) is
\[
d(\frac{p_1}{p_i}\zeta_i)\wedge\dots\wedge d\zeta_i \wedge \dots\wedge d(\frac{p_n}{p_i}\zeta_i) =
\zeta_i^{n-1}d(\frac{p_1}{p_i})\wedge\dots\wedge d\zeta_i\wedge\dots\wedge d(\frac{p_n}{p_i})
\]
which vanishes with order \( n-1 \).

For the consequence, note that \( \mathcal{K}_E = \mathcal{O}(-n) = \restr{(K_{\hat X}\otimes
\mathcal{O}(E))}{E} = \restr{(\pi^* K_{X}\otimes
\mathcal{O}(nE))}{E} \), but \( \pi^* K_X \) is trivial over \( E \), therefore \(
\restr{\mathcal{O}(E)}{E} = \mathcal{O}(-1) \).

#+BEGIN_theorem
#+LATEX: \label{thm:Kodaira-vanishing}
Let \( X \) be a compact complex manifold of dimension \( n \) and \( L \) is a positive
holomorphic line bundle on \( X \), i.e. there exists a hermitian metric \( h \) on \( L
\) such that the Chern form \( \omega_{L,h} \) is positive (i.e. a Kahler form). Then
\[
H^q(X,\Omega_X^p \otimes \mathcal{L}) = 0 \quad\forall p+q >n.
\]
In particular, 
\[ 
H^i(X, K_X\otimes \mathcal{L}) = 0 \quad \forall i>0.
\]
#+END_theorem

#+BEGIN_proof
Since \( \mathcal{H}^{0,q}(E) \simeq H^q(X,\mathcal{E}) \) for all hermitian holomorphic vector bundle \( E \)
with \( \mathcal{E} \) the corresponding sheaf of holomorphic sections. One needs to prove
that all harmonic form in \( \mathcal{A}_X^{p,q}(L) \) vanishes for \( p+q>n \). This
comes from the following two identities: Let \( \nabla \) be the Chern connection on \( L
\) and \( \nabla = \nabla' + \nabla'' \) be its decomposition to \( (1,0) \) and \( (0,1)
\) operators and \( \Delta_L' \) be the Laplacian corresponding to \( \nabla' \) then
1. \( \Delta_L = \Delta'_L + 2\pi[L,\Lambda] \) where \( L \) and \( \Lambda \) are Lefshetz operators.
2. \([L,\Lambda] = (k-n)Id_{\mathcal{A}^k_X}\)
Therefore \( 0\leq(\alpha,\Delta'a)_{L^2} = 2\pi (n-k)(\alpha,\alpha)_{L^2}\leq 0 \)

Let \( X \) be a compact complex manifold with \( L \) a positive holomorphic line bundle
on \( X \). Then \( L \) is generated by finitely many of its global sections and \( X \)

sufficiently large.

The following approache is straight-forward: one shows that at every \( x\in X \), there
is a global (holomorphic) section \( s_x \) of \( L^{\otimes m_x} \) such that \( s_x(x)\ne 0 \) then by
compactness one can choose finitely many such sections and \( m_x \) which can be guaranteed to generate
every germs at \( x \) of \( L^{\otimes m} \) with \( m=\max m_x \). That is one needs to prove that

where the vertical arrows are isomorphic (easy to see, maybe the right one needs
Hartog). So one only needs to see that  \(H^0(\hat X,\pi^*\mathcal{L}^{\otimes m_x})
\twoheadrightarrow H^0(E,\restr{\pi^*\mathcal{L}^{\otimes m_x}}{E})\). Since \( E \) is
a divisor of \( \hat X \), one has
$
0 \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}(E) \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_{\hat X} \longrightarrow
\mathcal{O}_E \longrightarrow 0
$
hence 
\[
0 \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}(E)\otimes\pi^* \mathcal{L}^{\otimes m_x} \longrightarrow \pi^* \mathcal{L}^{\otimes m_x} \longrightarrow
\restr{\pi^*\mathcal{L}^{\otimes m_x}}{E} \longrightarrow 0.
\]

It remains to prove that \( H^1(\hat X, \mathcal{O}(E)\otimes\pi^* \mathcal{L}^{\otimes
m_x}) \), or by ref:thm:Kodaira-vanishing, that \( \mathcal{O}(E)\otimes\pi^*
\mathcal{L}^{\otimes m_x}\otimes K_{\hat X}^{-1} = \mathcal{O}(-nE)\otimes\pi^*
(\mathcal{L}^{\otimes m_x}\otimes K_X^{-1}) \) is
positive, where we used the fact that \( K_{\hat X} = \pi^* K_X\otimes \mathcal{O}_{\hat
X}((n-1)E) \). 

Note that on \( \hat X \setminus E \), one can choose \( m_x \) large enough such that \(
\mathcal{L}^{\otimes m_x}\otimes K_X^{-1}\times \mathcal{O}(-nE) \) is positive. It
remains to observe \( E\subset \hat X \) which is in fact \( \mathbb{CP}^{n-1} \). But \(
\restr{\mathcal{O}(-E)}{E} \equiv \mathcal{O}(1) \) is positive, which concludes the proof.
