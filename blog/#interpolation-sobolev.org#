* Motivation

We will define a more general notion of Sobolev spaces on compact manifold than those in
cite:aubin_nonlinear_1998 and cite:jost_riemannian_2008, where Sobolev spaces on a
(Riemannian) manifold \( W^{k,p}(M) \) of dimension \( n \) are defined for
\( k\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0} \) and for /uniform weight/, i.e. a function \( f\in W^{k,p}(M)
\) is supposed to be weakly differentiable up to order \( k \) in every variables \(
x_1,\dots, x_n \) in each smooth coordinates. The space \( W^{k,p}(M) \) in this case can
be defined by density with respect to a certain norm involving derivatives \(
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^\alpha} \).

Meanwhile, the suitable function spaces to
solve parabolic equations are those whose regularity in time is half of that in space,
i.e. we will solve parabolic equations on the Sobolev spaces \( W^{k,p}(M\times T) \) of functions
\( k \) times regular in \( M \) and \( k/2 \) times regular in \( T \). We cannot always,
(for example when \( k \) is odd) find a simple norm involving derivatives of \( f \) in
order to define \( W^{k,p} \) by density. This generalisation will be done using Stein's
multipliers.

Another generalisation will be made is to allow the manifold to have boundary. Even when
we only want to solve parabolic equation on manifold \( M \) without boundary, the
underlying space is \( M\times [0, T] \) which has boundary. Moreover, we will have to
discuss the notion of trace in order to use the initial condition at \( t=0 \). 

All manifolds will be compact, with no given metric. This is not really a
generalisation since on compact manifolds, Sobolev spaces \( W^{k,p}(M) \), as defined in
cite:aubin_nonlinear_1998 and cite:jost_riemannian_2008 set theoretically do not depend on
the metric and (the equivalent class of) their norms also independent of the metric.

We will mainly follow the discussion in cite:hamilton_harmonic_1975, where the author also
works on manifold with /corner/, i.e. irregular boundary. The corners, modeled by \(
\mathbb{R}^{n-k}\times \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^k \), appear naturally,
for example at the boundary \( \partial M \) in \( t=0 \). The extra effort to cover the
case of corners is not much (see [[cite:hamilton_harmonic_1975][page 50]]) and essentially algebraic.

The advantage of this approach (Stein's multipliers and interpolation theory) over the
definition by density is that it is based on an algebraic framework compatible with
compact operators and capable of formulating analytic result economically. For example,
3 classical results of elliptic equations (existence and approximate solution, regularity,
Garding's inequality) can be nicely encoded in a commutative diagram and can be proved at
the same time (and the proof is essentially algebraic), see this [[./elliptic-parabolic.org][post]].

* Preparatory material
We will recall here basic elements of Fourier transform on the space of tempered
distributions and then we will have a quick review of interpolation theory.

** Stein's multiplier
Let \( X = \mathbb{R}^n \) be the Euclidean space, coordinated by \( x_1,\dots, x_n \) and
\( \mathcal{E}= \mathbb{R}^n \), coordinated by \( \xi_1,\dots,\xi_n \) be the frequency
domain of \( X \). Recall that Fourier transform is an isomorphism in the following three levels
1. The Schwartz space of rapidly decreasing smooth functions \( \mathcal{S}(X) \) whose elements
   are smooth and decrease more rapidly then any rational function. The Schwartz space are
   topologized by the family of semi-norms \( |f|_{\alpha,\beta}= \sup_X |x^{\alpha} D^b_x f(x)| \).
2. The space \( L^2(X) \) of doubly-integrable functions.
3. The space of tempered distributions, i.e. the dual space \(\mathcal{S}^*(X) \) of \(
   \mathcal{S}(X) \) under the weak-* topology given by \( \mathcal{S}(X) \).

To simplify the notation, we use \( D^\alpha_x = \left(\frac{1}{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial
x_1}\right)^{\alpha_1} \dots  \left(\frac{1}{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial
x_n}\right)^{\alpha_n}\) and \( P(D) = \sum_\alpha c_\alpha D^\alpha \) for any polynomial
\( P \). 

Recall that for any \( u\in \mathcal{S}(X) \)
and for any polynomial \( P \), one has  \( \widehat{P(D)u} = P(\xi)\hat u(\xi) \). This
can be extended to non-polynomial function of \( M(D) \) of \( D \) by
\[
 \widehat{M(D)u} := M(\xi)\hat u(\xi)
\]
where \( M \) is a slowly growing function, i.e. \( D^\alpha M(\xi) \) grows slower than
certain polynomial as \( |\xi|\to \infty \).

The following theorem give a criteria of the function \( M \) such that \( M(D):
\mathcal{S}(X) \longrightarrow \mathcal{S}(X) \) extend to \( L^p(X) \longrightarrow
L^p(X) \).

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Stein]

#+BEGIN_theorem
#+LATEX: \label{thm:stein-crit}
If for any /primitive/ index \( \alpha=(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n) \), i.e. each \( \alpha_i
\) being \( 0 \) or \( 1 \) (there are exactly \( 2^n \) primitive indices), one has
\[
 \left| \xi^\alpha D^\alpha M(\xi)\right| \leq C_\alpha
\]
then \( M(D) \) extend to a bounded linear operator on \( L^p(X) \).
#+END_theorem

#+BEGIN_definition
1. A slowly growing function \( W \) on \( \mathcal{E} \) with \( W(\xi)>0 \) is called a
   *weight* if for all primitive index \( \alpha \), one has
   \[
   \left|\xi^\alpha D^\alpha W(\xi)\right|\leq C_\alpha W(\xi).
   \]
2. The *Sobolev space* \( W^{k,p}(X,W) \) with respect to weight \( W \), \( k\in
   \mathbb{R}, 1<p<\infty \) is the vector space
   \[
    W^{k,p}(X,W) = \left\{ u\in \mathcal{S}^*(X):\ W(D)^k u \in L^p(X)\right\}
   \]
   normed by \( \|u\|_{W^{k,p}} = \| W(D)^k u\|_{L^p} \).

#+BEGIN_exampl
Note by \( \sigma:= \lcm(\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n) \) then \( W_\Sigma(\xi) = \left( 1 +
\xi_1^{2\sigma_1} + \dots + \xi_n^{2\sigma_n} \right)^{1/2\sigma} \) is a weight. We will
only use weights of this type in our discussion. The index \( \Sigma =
(\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n) \) is chosen according to the differential operator in the
elliptic/parabolic equation. In particular, for Laplace equation, one choose \(
\Sigma=(1,\dots, 1) \) and for heat equation \( \Sigma = (1,2,\dots, 2) \) where \( 1 \)
is in the time component.
#+END_exampl

#+ATTR_HTML: :id rem:weight
#+BEGIN_remark
#+LATEX: \label{rem:weight}
1. If \( W_1,W_2 \) are weights then \( W_1 + s W_2, W_1 W_2, W_1^s (s>0)\) are also weights.
2. The operator \( W(D):\ W^{k+r},p(X,W) \longrightarrow W^{k,p}(X) \) is bounded.
3. Given another weight \( V(\xi) \leq C W(\xi) \), by Stein's criteria (Theorem
   ref:thm:stein-crit) one has a bounded embedding \( W^{k,p}(X,W) \hookrightarrow  W^{k,p}(X,V) \).
#+END_remark

The Sobolev space \( W^{k,p}(X,W_\Sigma \) has a simple definition by density when \( \sigma \mid
k \). Given an index \( \alpha = (\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n) \), note by
\(
 \|\alpha\| := \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i \frac{\sigma}{\sigma_i}.
\)

#+ATTR_HTML: :id thm:equiv-norm-Sobolev :btit (Equivalent norm when \( \sigma \mid k \)) 
#+BEGIN_theorem
#+LATEX: \label{thm:equiv-norm-Sobolev}
If \( k>0 \) and \( \sigma \mid k \) and \( 1<p<\infty \), then given \( u\in
\mathcal{S}^*(X) \), one has
1. \(u\in W^{k,p}(X)\) if and only if \( D^\alpha u\in L^p(X) \) for all \( \|\alpha\|\leq k
   \) and the norm \( \sum_{\| \alpha \leq k\|} \|D^\alpha u\|_{L^p} \) is equivalent to \( \|u\|_{W^{k,p}} \).
2. \( u\in W^{-k,p} \) if and only if there exists \( g_\alpha\in L^p \) such that \( u =
   \sum_{\|\alpha\|\leq k} D^\alpha g_\alpha \) and \( \|u\|_{W^{-k,p}} \) is equivalent
   to
   \[
    \inf \left\{ \sum_{\|\alpha\| \leq k} \|g_\alpha\|_{L^p}:\ u = \sum_{\|\alpha\|\leq k}
   D^\alpha g_\alpha \right\}
   \]
#+END_theorem

#+BEGIN_exampl
1. When \( \sigma_1=\dots=\sigma_n=1 \), one has the familiar Sobolev spaces.
2. For (the weight of) heat equation, \( W^{2,p} \) cam be defined by density using the
   norm
   \[
    \|u(t,x)\| = \left\|\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\right\|_{L^p} +
   \left\|Du \right\|_{L^p} + \left\|D u\right\|_{L^p}
   \]
   where \( L^p \) stands for \( L^p(X\times [0,T]) \).

** Holomorphic interpolation of Banach spaces

The Interpolation theory is based on the following Three-lines theorem whose proof follows
from the classic [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_three-lines_theorem][Hadamard's three-lines theorem]] (the case \( A=\mathbb{C} \) and how we
define complex Banach spaces and holomorphic functions taking value there.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Three-lines]
#+ATTR_HTML: :id thm:3-line :btit (Three-line) 
#+BEGIN_theorem
#+LATEX: \label{thm:3-line}
Let \( A \) be a complex Banach space and \( h:\ S=\left \{0\leq {\rm Re} z\leq 1\right\}\subset
\mathbb{C} \longrightarrow  A  \) be a holomorphic function, i.e. continuous and
holomorphic in the interior such that \( h \) is bounded at infinity, i.e. \( h(x+iy)
\to 0 \) as \( y \to \infty \). Let \( M(x):=\sup_y \|h(x+iy)\| \) then one has
\[
 M(x)\leq M(1)^x M(0)^{1-x}
\]
#+END_theorem

Let \( A_0, A_1 \) be complex Banach spaces such that 
1. \( A_0, A_1 \) can be continuously embedded into a Hausdorff topological complex vector
   space \( E \) such that the complex structures are compatible with each others,
   i.e. the linear embeddings preserve complex structures.
2. The intersection \( A_0\cap A_1 \) in \( E \) is dense in \( (A_i,\|\|_{A_i}) \) for \( i=0,1 \).
such \( (A_0,A_1) \) is called an *interpolatable* pair.
