By the sake of de Rham decomposition, we now focus more in Riemannian manifold with irreducible
holonomy representation. The theory of Lie groups allows us to understand symmetric spaces.

\begin{definition}
  A Riemannian manifold $M$ is called {\em symmetric} if for every $x\in M$, there exists a
  isometry $s_x$ of $M$ such that $x$ is an isolated fixed point and $s_x^2=Id$.
\end{definition}

Let $x\in M$ and $v\in T_xM$, we note by $\exp_x(v)$ the point of distance $|v|$ in the geodesic
starting in $x$ with velocity $v/|v|$. We remark that any isometry $s_x$ with $s_x^2=Id$ and $x$ as isolated fixed
point satisfies 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sxreverse}
s_x(\exp_x(v)) = \exp_x(-v)
\end{equation}
In fact the eigenvalues of $T_xs_x$ have to be $1$ or $-1$, but as $x$ is an isolated fixed point
one has $T_xs_x = -Id$. Then $s_x$ as an isometry sends the geodesic starting at $x$ with velocity
$v$ to one starting at $s_x(x)=x$ with velocity $T_xs_x.v = -v$ and we have \eqref{eq:sxreverse}.


Equation \eqref{eq:sxreverse} tells us that $s_x$ is a reflection of center $x$ on every geodesic
passing by $x$. We can now compose two reflection $s_x,s_y$ to form a translation on the geodesic
connecting $x$ and $y$. This shows that a symmetric space is complete and the group of isometries
of the form $s_x\circ s_y$ acts transitively on $M$.

\begin{theorem}[Symmetric space]
  Let $M$ be a symmetric Riemannian manifold then $M$ is complete. Fix $x_0\in M$, let $G$ be the
  group generated by the isometries of form $s_x\circ s_y,\ x,y\in M$ and $H$ the subgroup
  containing elements of $G$ that fix $x_0$, then $G$ is Lie subgroup of $Iso(M)$ connected by arc,
  $H$ is a closed Lie subgroup of $G$ and $M$ is isometric to $G/H$. Moreover the holonomy group of
  $M$ is $H$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
E. Cartan solved it completely.
\end{remark}


The previous results can be extended to locally symmetric spaces.

\begin{definition}[Lemma]
Let $M$ is a Riemannian manifold, the followings are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item For every $x\in M$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ and an isometry
  $s_x:\ U\longrightarrow U$ such that $s_x^2=Id$ and $x$ is the unique fixed point of $s_x$.
\item The curvature tensor $R$ satisfies
\[
\nabla R = 0
\]
\end{enumerate}
In this case, $M$ is called {\em locally symmetric}.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Locally symmetric space]
Let $M$ be a locally symmetric Riemannian manifold, then there exists a unique symmetric simply
connected Riemannian manifold $N$ such that $M$ and $N$ are locally isometric, i.e. for every
$x\in M$ and $y\in N$, there exists neighborhoods $U$ of $x$ and $V$ of $y$ that are isometric.
\end{theorem}
As a result, the holonomy group can not tell the difference between a symmetric and a locally
symmetric manifold.
