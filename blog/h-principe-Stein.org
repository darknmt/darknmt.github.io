This is the note of my presentation as final exam of the course /Introduction au h-principe de Gromov/ given by
[[https://www.math.u-psud.fr/~pmassot/][Patrick Massot]] at Departement de MathÃ©matiques d'Orsay. I presented how Cieliebak and
Eliashberg cite:cieliebak_stein_2013 applied h-principle to characterise the topology of
Stein manifold. Further discussion can be found in the book cite:eliashberg_stein_2012.

* The statement of Cieliebak-Eliashberg about topology of Stein manifold.
Stein manifolds are affine schemes over \( \mathbb{C} \). There are many equivalent
definitions of Stein manifolds, but we will use the following two:
- They are complex manifolds that can be properly embedded into \( \mathbb{C}^N \) for
  some \( N\in \mathbb{Z}_{>0} \).
- They are complex manifolds that admit an /exhaustive/, /strictly plurisubharmonic/ (PSH)
  function \( \phi \). The exhaustive part means that \( \phi \) is a proper, real-value
  function bounded below, and the strictly plurisubharmonic part means that \( -dd^c
  \phi(v,Jv) > 0 \) for all tangent vector \( v \), where \( d^c\phi = d\phi\circ J \).

Strictly PSH condition locally reads: \( \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial z^i \bar\partial
z^j}\xi^i\bar\xi^j >0 \), this means that the restriction of \( \phi  \) on each complex
line is subharmonic, i.e. it satisfies the sub-mean property. 

Since we will frequently change the complex structure on manifold, it is better to make it
appear explicitly in the notation of plurisubharmonicity. So instead of saying a
function \( \phi \) is (strictly) PSH with respect to the complex structure \( J \), we
will say that \( \phi \) is \( J \)-convex.

Here are a few example of Stein manifolds:
1. The complex affine spaces \( \mathbb{C}^n \), a sub complex manifold of \( \mathbb{C}^N
   \).
2. Let \( X \) be a closed sub complex manifold of \( \mathbb{P}^N_{\mathbb{C}} \) and \(
   H \subset \mathbb{P}^N_{\mathbb{C}}\) be a complex hyperplan. Then \( X\setminus H
   \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^N_{\mathbb{C}}\setminus H = \mathbb{C}^N \) is a Stein manifold.

Our goal will be to answer the following question:

*Question.* Topologically, what are Stein manifolds.

In other words, we want to find a necessary and sufficient condition of a differential
manifold \( V \) (without boundary) such that we can equip \( V \) with a complex structure \( J \) that
makes it a Stein manifold. It is easy to see that the following two conditions are
necessary:
1. \( V \) admits an almost complex structure.
2. \( V \) is an open manifold, i.e. there is no compact connected component of \( V
   \). This is an immediate consequence of Maximum modulus principle for holomorphic functions.

There is another less obvious necessary condition:

#+ATTR_HTML: :id rem:third-cond
#+BEGIN_remark
#+LATEX: \label{rem:third-cond}
Let \( (V,J,\phi) \) be a Stein manifold. By a generic perturbation we can suppose that \(
\phi \) is a Morse function (the Hessian of \( \phi \) is non-degenerate at the critical
points of \( \phi \)). Then the index of any critical point \( p \) of \( \phi \) is less
than \( n = \dim_\mathbb{C}V \).
#+END_remark

The remark follows from a kind of Pigeonhole principle. Suppose that the index of \( p \)
is strictly bigger than \( n \), then there exists a complex dimension in \( T_pV \) where
the Hessian of \( \phi \) is definite negative, this means that there is a complex curve \(
C \) passing by \( p \) on which the function \( \phi \) admits a local maximum at \( p
\). This contradicts the pluriharmonicity.

It was proved by Cieliebak and Eliashberg that these conditions are sufficient.

#+BEGIN_theorem
#+LATEX: \label{thm:topo-Stein}
Let \( V \) be a smooth manifold of real dimension \( 2n > 4 \) and \( J  \) be an almost
complex structure on \( V \) and \( \phi \) be an exhaustive Morse function without any
critical points of index \( k > n \). Then there exists an integrable complex structure \(
\tilde J \)  such that \( (V,\tilde J) \) is a Stein manifold.
#+END_theorem

In fact, the authors proved that one can obtain \( \tilde J \) by a homotopy of \( J \)
and the function \( \phi \) is \( \tilde J \)-convex. In the next part, we will not only
modify the complex structure \( J \), but also modify the function \( \phi \) to a
PSH function.
