===================================================

Source code
-----------
The source code of this project can be found `here <https://darknmt.github.io/StagePSA/code.zip>`_.
As I am not a majored in Computer Sciences and rarely take courses in the field,
my code is far from well-organized or optimized.

.. note:: The code is still incomplete, the Mix-Integer-Programming is still under development.

Wiki page
---------
`My Notebook <https://darknmt.github.io/StagePSA/wiki>`_ can be used as a wiki page
for this project. It contains some thoughts and ideas behind technical details in
the code. The notebook use `TiddlyWiki 5 <http://tiddlywiki.com>`_.
