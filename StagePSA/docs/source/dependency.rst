Dependency
==========



The dependency of our code is quite standard. You will need Python (preferably 2.7)
with `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ and `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org>`_,
which are well known among the scientific computing community. There are many ways
to install these packages, we recommend using Anaconda, as it is well known and
can save you a lot of time later.

With Anaconda
-------------

These packages come pre-installed if you have `Anaconda <https://anaconda.org>`_.
Basically you have nothing to do if you have Anaconda installed. Anaconda will set up
your Python environment automatically and and help get you out of the
`Dependency Hell <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell>`_. In case you
need to install an other package, use the command lines
``conda search <package>`` and ``conda install <package>``.


Linux: using package manager
----------------------------
If you use Linux, you can install the **python-matplotlib** and **python-numpy** package from your package manager.

Mac OSX: using Homebrew
-----------------------
If you use Mac OSX, you can install the **matplotlib** and **numpy** packages from ``brew`` command.
So just type ``brew install matplotlib`` and ``brew install numpy`` in your terminal.

Windows
-------
The most time-saving ways is really to install `Anaconda <https://anaconda.org>`_.
