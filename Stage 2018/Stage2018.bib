	abstract = {During the last few years, the field of nonlinear problems has undergone great development.This book, the core of which is the content of the author's earlier book (Springer-Verlag 1983), updated and extended in each chapter, and augmented by several completely new chapters, deals with some important geometric problems that have only recently been solved or partially been solved. Each problem is explained with the present status of its solution and the most recent methods of approaching the proofs. The main aim is to explain some methods and new techniques, and to apply them to problems coming from geometry or from physics. It deals with such important subjects as variational methods, the continuity method, parabolic equations on fiber bundles, ideas concerning points of concentration, blowing-up technique, topological methods. ..........},

	abstract = {Riemannian geometry has today become a vast and important subject. This new book of Marcel Berger sets out to introduce readers to most of the living topics of the field and convey them quickly to the main results known to date. These results are stated without detailed proofs but the main ideas involved are described and motivated. This enables the reader to obtain a sweeping panoramic view of almost the entirety of the field. However, since a Riemannian manifold is, even initially, a subtle object, appealing to highly non-natural concepts, the first three chapters devote themselves to introducing the various concepts and tools of Riemannian geometry in the most natural and motivating way, following in particular Gauss and Riemann.},

	abstract = {This established reference work continues to lead its readers to some of the hottest topics of contemporary mathematical research. The previous edition already introduced and explained the ideas of the parabolic methods that had found a spectacular success in the work of Perelman at the examples of closed geodesics and harmonic forms. It also discussed further examples of geometric variational problems from quantum field theory, another source of profound new ideas and methods in geometry. The 6th edition includes a systematic treatment of eigenvalues of Riemannian manifolds and several other additions. Also, the entire material has been reorganized in order to improve the coherence of the book.From the reviews: "This book provides a very readable introduction to Riemannian geometry and geometric analysis. ... With the vast development of the mathematical subject of geometric analysis, the present textbook is most welcome." Mathematical Reviews"...the material ... is self-contained. Each chapter ends with a set of exercises. Most of the paragraphs have a section ‘Perspectives’, written with the aim to place the material in a broader context and explain further results and directions." Zentralblatt MATH},
