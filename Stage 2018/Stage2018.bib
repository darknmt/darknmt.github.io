	abstract = {Einstein's equations stem from General Relativity. In the context of Riemannian manifolds, an independent mathematical theory has developed around them. Recently, it has produced several striking results, which have been of great interest also to physicists. This Ergebnisse volume is the first book which presents an up-to-date overview of the state of the art in this field. "Einstein Manifold"s is a successful attempt to organize the abundant literature, with emphasis on examples. Parts of it can be used separately as introduction to modern Riemannian geometry through topics like homogeneous spaces, submersions, or Riemannian functionals.},

	abstract = {During the last few years, the field of nonlinear problems has undergone great development.This book, the core of which is the content of the author's earlier book (Springer-Verlag 1983), updated and extended in each chapter, and augmented by several completely new chapters, deals with some important geometric problems that have only recently been solved or partially been solved. Each problem is explained with the present status of its solution and the most recent methods of approaching the proofs. The main aim is to explain some methods and new techniques, and to apply them to problems coming from geometry or from physics. It deals with such important subjects as variational methods, the continuity method, parabolic equations on fiber bundles, ideas concerning points of concentration, blowing-up technique, topological methods. ..........},

	abstract = {This established reference work continues to lead its readers to some of the hottest topics of contemporary mathematical research.This new edition introduces and explains the ideas of the parabolic methods that have recently found such a spectacular success in the work of Perelman at the examples of closed geodesics and harmonic forms. It also discusses further examples of geometric variational problems from quantum field theory, another source of profound new ideas and methods in geometry. From the reviews:"This book provides a very readable introduction to Riemannian geometry and geometric analysis. The author focuses on using analytic methods in the study of some fundamental theorems in Riemannian geometry, e.g., the Hodge theorem, the Rauch comparison theorem, the Lyusternik and Fet theorem and the existence of harmonic mappings. With the vast development of the mathematical subject of geometric analysis, the present textbook is most welcome. [..] The book is made more interesting by the perspectives in various sections."
