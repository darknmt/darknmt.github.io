1. Grassmannian is a homogeneous space (quotient of Lie group) $Grass(k,n) = O(n)/(O(k)\times
   O(n-k))$ of dimension $k(n-k)$.
2. Kervaire (1961) found a topological manifold that has no differential structure.
3. Classification of surfaces: Topological equivalence implies differential equivalence.

haha
* TODO Levels of classification:
1. Homology: Betty numbers, etc...
2. Homotopy type
3. Homeomorphy
4. Diffeomorphy: Quotient Diffeo/ Homeo is finite when dimension > 4.


* TODO Riemann submersion

* TODO Normal coordinates in Riemannian behaves nicely

* TODO Curvature
